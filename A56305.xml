            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Which thing is ſince evident by many paſſages in his Papers as that in his Epiſtle to the Reader, where he hath theſe words, viz. <hi>My juſt and neceſſary defence is kept from the ſimple hearted amongſt them, after whom my ſoul longs, and for whoſe ſakes it was principally intended,</hi> &amp;c.

            <p>THou art deſired further to take notice, that Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration from a true Church of Chriſt and Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of Gods People, is a dangerous thing:</p>
            <p>Firſt, it is ſharply threatned by God, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 38, 39.</p>
            <p>Secondly, ſeverely puniſhed, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 20, 21, 22.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, by this they diſcover themſelves both to the Church with whom they walked, and alſo to thoſe that are without, that they are the men and women who have not a true foundation, but onely have received ſome large meaſures of illumination, and common gifts and graces of the Holy Ghoſt, and ſo fall away, and by their Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacy, evidence their hypocriſie: Let no man think that the good can depart from the Church, wind blows not away the Wheat but the vain Chaff, 1 <hi>John</hi> 2. 19. <hi>They went out from us, but they were not of us, for if they had been of us, they would no doubt, have continued with us, but they went out that they might be made manifeſt that they were not of us.</hi> Now to prevent the ſpreadings of the ſpirit of Anti-chriſt and his ſubtil endeavours to draw more from Jeſus Chriſt, ought not the Church from whom theſe perſons are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted in obedience to the Command of God, and out of love to the ſouls of thoſe that have caſt the Ordinances of God behind their backs, ſend two or three of their Members in the Name of the Lord Jeſus, and in the tender bowels of pity, to beſeech, admoniſh, and warn them to repent of their ſins, and refrain from their evil waies, and return to the Truth, Faith, and waies of

Let the Reader ſeriouſly conſider, whether the Church is not engaged by her Head and Husband Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. from 15. to<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 20. verſ. compared with <hi>Titus</hi> 3. 10. &amp;c. thus to admoniſh and warn her deluded back-ſlidden Members, although perhaps ſome of them will not hear, as in <hi>Prov:</hi> 10: 17. Others reject both the Reproof and the Reprovers, <hi>Prov:</hi> 15: 10, 12.</p>
            <p>And laſtly, perhaps another laies open his folly to the whole Nation, in caſting dirt in the face not only of the Reprovers, but on the whole Church it ſelf that ſent them, and ſo endeavour to ſhame them both, ſee <hi>Prov:</hi> 9: 7. compared with <hi>Prov:</hi> 15: 12.

            <p>We have of late met with a little Book put forth by you, the Title of which when we had read, and ſeriouſly conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the People included and intended by you in thoſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, we could not but even ſtand amazed to think, unto what a height of Impudency and Malignity you are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready come, and whither may not a poor fallen creature run if God ſtop him not? Is it not a high degree of <hi>Luci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferian</hi>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:30607:6"/>
pride, for a poor creature, to ſet his foot upon the necks of all the Aſſemblies and Churches of the Saints this day in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Wales,</hi> calling them the Whore, (as your expreſſions muſt needs import) for if this Church in <hi>Briſtol</hi> be the Skirts of the Whore, then other Churches in your account muſt needs be the Whore, we being indeed but as the Skirts, or out-caſts of <hi>Sion:</hi> but for your hard cenſures we ſhall leave to him that holdeth the ſeven Stars in his right hand, and that walketh among the golden Candle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticks; in the mean time we ſhall take up <hi>Davids</hi> reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, when <hi>Shimei</hi> curſed him, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16. 12. <hi>It may be the Lord will look on our affliction,</hi> (or tears) <hi>and that the Lord will requite good for his curſing this day.</hi> Oh how do the daughters of the <hi>Philiſtims</hi> rejoyce, and the uncircumciſed triumph?

            <p>Poor man, you often told us there was ſome <hi>Judas</hi> in the Church, but little did we think that ever you would have acted ſo like <hi>Judas,</hi> as firſt to betray us with a kiſs, calling us friends, and then deliver us into the hands of our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to ſcourge us with their tongues, and to ſpit in our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and ſo to condemne us and the way of truth which we profeſs, hardning their hearts againſt it; yea, will not all that paſs by clap their hands, hiſs, and wag their heads at us, and ſay? is this a Church of <hi>Briſtol,</hi> that men uſe to call an Aſſembly of <hi>Sion?</hi> &amp;c. are theſe your gathered Churches, about which there hath been ſo much contending of late? nay then we will continue in our Pariſh Aſſemblies ſtill,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:30607:7"/>
we will never believe ſeparation to be the way of God, nor any of the ſeparated Congregations to be the Churches of Chriſt, but rather the Synagogues of Satan, &amp;c. O<hi>!</hi> are not theſe the thoughts and ſayings of many at this day? and how ſhall we anſwer theſe things? Muſt we not make our ſolemn addreſſes unto God? and ſay as <hi>Nehemiah</hi> 4. 4, 5. <hi>Hear O our God for we are deſpiſed, and turn his reproach up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his own head</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>You alſo ſtile us the mingled People, whom you reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully call the <hi>Independent, Baptized,</hi> &amp;c. O poor man, was it not enough that you had often ſpoken reproachfully againſt that bleſſed Inſtitution of Chriſt, which he in his own per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon practiſed when he was about thirty years of age, <hi>Luke</hi> 3. 21, 23. and left as a ſtanding Ordinance of the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to all Generations till his coming again, you calling it as you have often done, that ugly thing of Baptiſm, and ſo taking it quite away, neither practiſing it upon your chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren for many years, nor allowing it to believers; but that you ſhould now with deſpiteful hatred open your mouth in blaſphemy againſt God, and againſt his Tabernacle.</p>
            <p>Is it a light thing that you have caſt off, and do neglect to practiſe the Commands and Ordinances of Jeſus Chriſt, written in his word; but you muſt write contemptuouſly againſt them, that do in conſcience and obedience unto him, walk in the practiſe of them: you call us a mingled people, you might poſſibly have ſpoken true, had you ſaid ſo of us before you and the reſt left us, for we had (as it is to be feared) a company of rotten Profeſſors mingled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us, ſome of which never brought any great honor to Chriſt, but ſince you and they left us, we do not know any ſoul in the Church, but is able to give a good account of their Faith in Chriſt, and are careful to walk in all the waies of Chriſt, ſo far as they have obtained: But for that min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gling the which you mean, of perſons differing in their judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments about ſomethings, &amp;c. you know in your own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, that it was and is the principle of this Church to own and receive any that are truly godly, though differing in ſome things; and ſo you your ſelf did readily receive our Brother <hi>Simpſon</hi> though baptized, and you gave way to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:30607:7"/>
of the Church to be baptized, though now you ſcornfully ſtile us a mingled People.</p>
            <p>But the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> or the Church of the <hi>Romans,</hi> or the Church of <hi>Philippi,</hi> among whom there were many that did differ in their Judgments about ſome things, yet were not ſtiled a mingled people, a harlot, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>But had ſome of thoſe that went with you been faithful to their light, to have practiſed the Ordinance of Baptiſm, when they were convinced of it, they might have been ſome of the mingled too, as you call us; and what a preſervative that might have been to them, we ſhall not determine, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly this is obſervable, that there was not, nor is not one of all thoſe that have practiſed the Ordinance of Baptiſm with us that have fallen away, but onely one that was long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore drawn away by the People called <hi>Free-willers.</hi> You ſay we call our ſelves a Church of Chriſt in <hi>Briſtol,</hi> &amp;c. We anſwer, hath not Chriſt called us ſo, and owned us ſo? ſurely you and others have ſolemnly profeſſed, that Chriſt hath e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidently manifeſted his preſence in this Church; beſides, you and others can teſtifie that ſhe was at firſt rightly conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, according to the light that God gave to his People in the work of gathering Churches at that time, but it may be you will ſay, ſhe is grown carnal and become a harlot, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>We ſhall not proudly boaſt, but humbly acknowledge both to the Lord and to men, that we have many weakneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and failings, which is matter of daily grief and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint; but where do you find that ever Jeſus Chriſt did un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>church a People for ſuch weakneſſes as they did acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and bewaile, ſo long as they did not caſt off him, nor the faith of him, nor their obedience to him; read over the Epiſtles written to the Churches, either <hi>Corinth,</hi> or the Churches of <hi>Galatia,</hi> or the ſeven Churches of <hi>Aſia,</hi> among whom there were many very great weakneſſes and miſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages; pray read and conſider, 1 <hi>Cor:</hi> 5. 1. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 20, 21. <hi>Rev.</hi> 20. 3. and yet Chriſt nor his Apoſtles doth not unchurch them; and who are you then, that durſt ſo proud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſet your foot upon the neck of this poor Church<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and trample her down as a harlot, a Synagogue of Satan? &amp;c.

Again conſider, who were thoſe that are ſaid to be of the Synagogue of Satan, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 9 &amp; 3. 9. It was not the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches that were called ſo, for Chriſt owned them as Churches, and ſtiled them ſo, though they had many miſcarriages; but thoſe that were ſtiled of the Synagogue of Satan, were a company of proud boaſters, that ſaid they were Jews and Apoſtles, but did lie and were not; ſo now conſider, who are thoſe at this day, that call themſelves Apoſtles, and boaſt of perfection; do any of us do ſo, or do not they that ye own do ſo; and hath not the Church of <hi>Briſtol</hi> try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them and their Doctrins, and found them lyars, and their Doctrins falſe? as the Church of <hi>Epheſus</hi> did, <hi>Rev.</hi>

perſons, calling them a Synagogue of Satan? &amp;c. and that for no other cauſe, but that after praying for you and mourning over you, we ſent three times in love and pity to admoniſh you of the evil of your way; you ſhould now break out thus violently againſt us? O bluſh and roul your ſelf in the duſt, that if yet the day of Grace, and door of Mercy be not ſhut againſt you.

Truly we could have been glad that you had ſpared us that pains; and had not conſcience of our duty, and love to the name of the Lord, and to your ſoul prevailed with us, more than any delight we had in that work, you had never heard of us in that kind You ſay it is, by you, for the ſake of the ſimple hearted among us, publiſhed; bleſſed be the Lord there are ſome ſimple plain honeſt hearted amongſt us, had you and the reſt been ſo, no doubt you would have ſtayed with us; and thus much for the firſt branch of your Title page.</p>
            <p>We obſerve that you begin your Epiſtle to the Reader, as likewiſe your Book, with the word outward fellowſhip, &amp;c. Truly we ſhall eaſily grant, that your fellowſhip in the things of God, was but outward; for had it been inward and ſpiritual in truth and ſincerity, you would, no doubt, have continued in it, but as it is written, 1 <hi>John</hi> 2 19. <hi>They went out from us, becauſe they were not of us.</hi> We ſhall not ſpend time to anſwer every paſſage in your Letter, leſt as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>Prov.</hi> 26<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 4. <hi>we ſhould be like unto you;</hi> and yet we ſhall anſwer ſome things, leſt as <hi>Prov.</hi> 26 5. <hi>you ſhould be wiſe in your own conceit.</hi> As for thoſe Scripture expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in your Book, though miſapplied by you, yet we hope we ſhall conſider them, and examine our ſelves by them, though not as they come from you, but as they are the words of God: and as for thoſe taunts, ſcorns, falſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſations, judgings and condemnations, of which your Pamphlet is full, we hope we may as we have opportunity ſpread them before the Lord, as <hi>Hezekiah</hi> did the Letter that he received, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 37. 14. we being otherwiſe taught than to render evil for evil, or railing for railing but rather to bleſs, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 9. having the example of Chriſt herein, as
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:30607:9"/>
well as a Precept hereto, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 23. <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 44. yet we cannot but take notice of the abſurdity of your arguing and proceeding, wherein you firſt beg the queſtion, and then draw what inferences you pleaſe: you firſt ſtile us a Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue of Satan, &amp;c. and then heap up threatnings againſt us as ſuch, &amp;c. much like the heathen perſecutors of old, who would firſt wrap the Saints in the skins of Beaſts, and then ſet the dogs upon them to tear them, &amp;c. Would you not count it an abſurd thing if any man ſhould come to you, and heap up all the Scriptures that ſpeak againſt mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derers, Adulterers, Drunkards, Swearers, Lyers, Theeves, &amp;c. and apply them unto you, taking it for granted that you are ſuch a one; and then ask you if this be not Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture? &amp;c. Or on the other ſide, if one ſhould take all the Scriptures that ſpeak comfort to the true Saints, in a ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and perſecuted condition, and apply them to a common thief that is caſt in priſon for his wickedneſs, or to a Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor that is going to ſuffer juſtly for his evil deeds? &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Now this is juſt your way of reaſoning, (and many others with you) firſt to heap up multitudes of Scriptures that ſpeak againſt the Whore of Babylon, againſt Anti-chriſt, againſt the Beaſt, and the falſe Prophets, againſt Hypocrites and Rejectors of the Goſpel, and againſt other ungodly and wicked perſons, &amp;c. and apply all this to whom you pleaſe, either to the Churches of Chriſt, or to the faithful preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the Goſpel, or to any other godly people; right or wrong, if they ſtand in your way, you conclude they are ſuch becauſe you call them ſo, whereas they may as ſoon prove the former things againſt you, as you can prove the later a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them; ſo likewiſe the comforts and promiſes made to ſuffering Saints, may as well be applyed to a common thief, &amp;c. As to ſome of thoſe that you ſtile the Servants and Witneſſes of Jeſus, and this we find was <hi>Rabſhaketh</hi> his way of arguing with <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 18. 22. Now had <hi>Hezekiah</hi> been the man, and had he done the things that <hi>Rabſhaketh</hi> there charged him with, then he had reaſoned rightly, but <hi>Rabſhaketh</hi> was miſtaken in his foundation ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the things for granted, whereas there was no ſuch mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, for godly <hi>Hezekiah</hi> had done no ſuch thing, onely <hi>Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhaketh</hi>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:30607:9"/>
by his wit and ſubtilty framed ſuch arguments as he thought might accompliſh his deſign, namely to draw away the poor <hi>Iſralites</hi> out of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> where God had ſet them, and from <hi>Hezekiah</hi> whom God had ſet over them, to come forth to their enemies, as you may read at large, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 18. 30, 31, 32. and therefore do you conſider a little, what if you ſhould be miſtaken as <hi>Rabſhaketh</hi> was, who was as confident as you are; and ſuppoſe that ſome of them (at leaſt) whom you have cryed down as falſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets and Deceivers, ſhould be found the Servants of Chriſt, or that thoſe Churches in <hi>England,</hi> that you or ſome of your way call the well favoured Harlots, or that this poor deſpiſed people in <hi>Briſtol,</hi> that you ſo contemptuouſly trample upon, calling them a Harlot, a Synagogue of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, &amp;c. ſhould at laſt be found the Churches of Chriſt, and that he ſhould own them as his People, his Spouſe, the dearly beloved of his Soul, and as thoſe whom he had ſhed his blood for, and given Grace unto? Oh! how will you then be confounded? &amp;c.</p>
            <p>And why may you not be miſtaken, ſeeing you have been miſtaken thus long, though few men upon earth were more confident of, and violent for ſome things than you have been, and yet you have been miſtaken, as you now ſay? there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore take heed, ceaſe judging of Churches, perſons or things, but leave that till he come, whoſe right it is to judge, and who will judge right, but if you ſhall go on ſtill to judge us, we ſhall make our application to the Lord, as <hi>David</hi> did, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 17. 1, 2. <hi>Hear the right O Lord,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Let our Sentence come forth from thy preſence.</hi> But the great matter you harp upon is, that your Letter could not be received nor read in the Church, &amp;c. Some of us had three reaſons a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it, firſt, becauſe it was not directed to the Church, but as it were in a deriding manner, <hi>viz. To the People cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Independents,</hi> though now you joyn <hi>Baptized</hi> with them; therfore if you would not own us as a Church, we might juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly refuſe to own or receive your Letter. Secondly, you were a perſon under admoniſhing, and had refuſed to hear the Churches Meſſengers, therefore we had no warrant to read nor hear your Letter. Thirdly, ſome of us underſtood
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:30607:10"/>
that your main deſign was to draw away ſome more to you, though the greateſt part of the Church were fully ſatisfied about the falſeneſs of your way, yet it may be, there were ſome weak, as there was in the Church of the <hi>Romans,</hi> and of the <hi>Corinthians, Rom.</hi> 14. 1. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 9. But as for your jeering at our weakneſs and febleneſs, and that we were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid of being ſhaken, concluding that fear had ſurpriſed the Hypocrites, and that we were the wicked that could not ſtand in Judgment, &amp;c. This is like <hi>Rabſhaketh</hi> dealing with <hi>Hezekiah</hi> and the poor Jews, &amp;c. as we told you before, but we acknowledg we are a poor, weak, and afflicted People, even the poor of the Flock whom the Lord hath yet preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, &amp;c. You likewiſe jeer at our Faſting day, which in other words you did to a Member of the Congregation, ſaying to this effect, What could they not open a Letter, but they muſt pray to their God, and now they have prayed will not their God hear them? as another of your compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny alſo jeering at our prayers, uſed theſe words, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 18. 26. <hi>O Baal hear us,</hi> &amp;c. But the truth is we did keep ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Faſting daies after you left us, and we can ſay, through grace<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that God did not ſhut his ear againſt our prayers, for <note place="margin">

               </note> not one Soul went from us after we did ſo<hi>:</hi> As for your reviling and reproaching that godly man, our Brother <hi>Simp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> by name, it may be when your Pamphlet comes into a far Country, where neither he nor you are known, ſome may believe what you write, but in <hi>Briſtol,</hi> or any other place where he and you are well known, your tongue will prove no ſlander; for his humility, integrity, and godlineſs, is better known than to be darkned by your pen, but we ſhall leave him to clear his own innocency<hi>:</hi> As for your Epiſtle to the Churches and Elders in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Wales,</hi> and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly to thoſe in <hi>Eſſex</hi> and <hi>Norfolk,</hi> we ſhall leave that to them, either to make their Appeals to the Lord, or their Anſwer to you.</p>
            <p>As for what you obſerved in eminent Church-Members, and other high Pretenders to Religion, (as you ſay) while you ſate in Parliament, and other chief places of Council and truſt in the Nation, we ſhall ſay nothing to that, only this we do remember, and did obſerve in what a height of

diſcontent you came home, and continued one while cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out againſt the Prieſts, and falſe Prophets, another while againſt Hypocrites, and ſometimes concluding and ſaying, that al the Religion then profeſt in <hi>England</hi> was nought, and that we muſt find out a new Religion, at which ſome of us were ſilent, as not knowing what you had ſeen and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved where you had been, though ſome of us did reply, as we doubt not but you doe remember; but in this poſture you continued till a new Religion came, which you pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently within few daies or weeks embraced, without ſo much as ſetting apart one hour with the Church to enquire of the Lord, what was in the bottom of that new Religion, but rather threatning of us, that if we did not ſpeedily come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way and embrace it we were all loſt, though you could not tell us of any thing we ſhould come unto.</p>
            <p>We come now to your chief Letter wherein you betray us again with a kiſs, calling us friends, &amp;c. As for your Preface, wherein you firſt diſown any power that we have over you, &amp;c. we ſhall not diſpute that, but reſolve to do our duty according to Scripture rule, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. <hi>Tit.</hi> 3. 10. 11. and ſhall leave the iſſue to him in whoſe hands are the hearts of all men.</p>
            <p>Secondly, as for your pretended faithfulneſs, but moſt unparallel'd impudency, and ſenſoriouſneſs, in judging us to be no Church of Chriſt, but a Synagogue of Satan, and a Cage of unclean and hateful Spirits, wherein lodgeth pride, hypocriſie, envy, ſlandering, back-biting, railing, lying, love to this preſent world, and conformity to the faſhions, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>We confeſs this is a ſad ſentence, to cloath neer threeſcore perſons with ſuch a ſpoted garment, many of which are able to give a better account of the work of grace in their ſouls, and of their faith in Chriſt, and have a more blameleſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, than ever we could hear of you, or obſerve in you; what ſecret ſeeds may be in the hearts of any among us we cannot ſay, neither durſt we proudly boaſt as others do, but this we muſt profeſs ingeniouſly that we never ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved ſo much of thoſe evils before mentioned to break forth upon any of thoſe that now are together, as we have
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:30607:11"/>
ſeen in you, and in ſome of thoſe that are gone away with you, and we are perſwaded there is no judicious Chriſtian this day in <hi>Briſtol,</hi> that hath known and obſerved you and us, but will ſay the ſame thing; ſo that there being ſo many ſuch perſons with your ſelf gone from us, we hope there is ſome Reformation in the Church, but if there ſhould ſtill remain any ſuch among us, (as we hope there doth not) ſurely we ſhall be ready to deal with them, as we have done with you and others, onely we muſt know they are ſuch, for we muſt not take the railing accuſations of our imbittered enemies for a ſufficient proof.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, you ſay, <hi>notwithſtanding there is that in ſome of us, after which your ſoul doth greatly long, that the ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of God were come out of Sion, &amp;c.</hi> We do believe there is many a ſoul in this Congregation, that doth long and groan day and night after more of the bleſſed Spirit of Jeſus Chriſt, that ſo they might know him better, believe on him more, love him more, and live more to him, and yet we truſt there is never a ſoul in this Congregation, but ſeeth ſufficient ground to ſtand at a diſtance from your Principles and waies; ſo that you may ceaſe hoping for any of them to come unto you, the Lord preſerving them by his grace.</p>
            <p>We come now to the five things in your Admoniſhing, a Copy of which we having by us, do here inſert <hi>verbatiam.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, your leaving the Church, which hath three ſad conſequences in it, as we judge<hi>:</hi> Firſt, the drawing of many away from the faith and waies of the Goſpel: Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the offending, grieving and ſtumbling of many weak ſouls: Thirdly the opening of the mouths of many to ſpeak evil of the waies of Truth, as 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 2.</p>
            <p>Secondly, your contemning of ſome, and neglecting of others of the Ordinances of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, your extream ſenſoriouſneſs and raſh judging, not only of perſons abroad, but alſo of the Church, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to <hi>Matt.</hi> 7. 1. <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 3. alſo your calling the Church an Harlot.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, your aſſerting in the Church Doctrins con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to Truth: As firſt, that we did not know what Faith
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:30607:11"/>
was, and that Faith was an eternal thing: Secondly, that Chriſt and Faith is all one: Thirdly, that Chriſt is not the object of Faith: Fourthly, your ſpeaking reproachfully of the bleſſed Scriptures, affirming they were blind, and a plague to ſouls; and further ſaying, they are not the Word of God, nor the Rule of Life.</p>
            <p>Now becauſe you ſay theſe are ſtudied Accuſations, and from the Father of lies, &amp;c. we ſhall therefore prove eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry title of theſe things to be true; Firſt, that you have left the Church, is true, and that your ſo doing hath drawn a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way ſome, grieved others, and opened the mouthes of many to ſpeak evil of the waies of Chriſt, this is clear and plain, and not a ſtudied accuſation, but a real thing, and that which hath been matter of grief and ſadneſs to the Church, and therefore we did ſend to admoniſh you of the evil of it: Now in that you reply, <hi>all judgment is given to the Son,</hi> whom you ſay we are ignorant of, and enemies to, &amp;c. and therefore what is our judgment worth, &amp;c. and then you go on to heap up fourteen dreadful Sentences a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt us, ſuch as the Spirit of God doth in Scripture give to Reprobates and caſt-awaies, and ſo conclude with that 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2. 8. Now we deſire any ſober Chriſtian to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of this your Anſwer, (which you call your defence to our charge, of which you complain you had much wrong, becauſe your Letter of defence was not read) whether this be a Chriſtian-like anſwer to the Admonition of a Church, you not giving us herein one word or reaſon of your departing from us, but onely heaping up 16. or 18. dreadful Sentences againſt us.</p>
            <p>The ſecond thing you were admoniſhed of, was your contemning of ſome, and neglecting of others of the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances of Chriſt: Firſt, that Ordinance which you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temn is Baptiſm in Water, which you utterly reject and caſt away, neither uſing it to your Children, nor allowing it to Believers, but calling it as you have often done, that ugly thing of Baptiſm; with other bitter and violent ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions againſt it, to the grief of ſome of us: Now we did not ſend to admoniſh you for not practiſing of it, for we knew your judgment was againſt it; but to admoniſh
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:30607:12"/>
you of your great ſin, in ſpeaking ſo contemptuouſly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it, calling ſome of them that practiſed it, ugly <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſts,</hi> as you have done in ſome of our hearing. Now whereas you call us hypocrites, &amp;c. becauſe as you ſay, we ſent to admoniſh you for not practiſing Baptiſm by Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; you ſpeak falſly and do us wrong, for we did not ſo, but onely for your contemning of it, which we ſhall leave to the Lord of Ordinances to judge. The ſecond Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance which you neglect, is the Lords Supper, and ſuch other Ordinances as are practiſed, and to be practiſed in the Churches of Chriſt; which that you do neglect is clear by your practiſe, &amp;c. And whereas you demand whether we had medled in any ſuch thing for ſome years paſt, and then fall a threatning of us again as hypocrites, with deceit and hypocriſie, &amp;c. To which we anſwer, you ſpeak falſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, for the Church never neglected that Ordinance of the Lords Supper any years; it is true that through your means and ſome others, the Church did forbear the practiſe of it about a year together; but it is one thing for a Church upon occaſion to forbear an Ordinance, and another thing totally to neglect it, or deny it as you do<hi>:</hi> but for your flying out as you do, in the firſt part of your Reply to this particular, againſt Inventions, Traditions, Imaginations of mens carnal wiſdom, &amp;c. We anſwer, we uſe no Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance but the Inſtitutions of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, which he hath commanded to be obſerved in his Churches till his coming again; in the mean while all men may ſee, we had ground to admoniſh you for the contempt of ſome, and neglect of other of the Ordinances of Chriſt; ſo that this is no lie, nor ſtudied accuſation as you call it<hi>:</hi> and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as you ſay in the cloſe of this Reply, that Baptiſm and the Lords Supper you own; Oh! how durſt you to publiſh ſuch equivocation to the World, when in your conſcience you know, you own neither of thoſe two Ordinances, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Baptiſm by Water, nor Breaking of Bread; why then do you uſe ſuch mental reſervations? deal plainly that men may know what you are, did you not ſay in the words preceding, that God requires truth in the inward parts, and then preſently write an abominable untruth? is there any fear of God before your eyes? &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:30607:12"/>
The third branch of your Admonition is, for your ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream ſenſoriouſneſs and raſh judging, not onlie of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons abroad, but alſo of the Church, calling it a Harlot, the truth of which ſenſoriouſneſs, the whole Church can teſtifie, yea we could give many particular inſtances were it neceſſary: but what need we go further than your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Letter, where, in your Reply to this third particular, you call the Church a Harlot, &amp;c. and page 20. where you, rehearſing what you had ſaid amongſt us before you left us, confeſs that you did at laſt ſay, our Church was but a Harlot; and yet now you ſay this charge is falſe, and from the Father of lies, and that the Church of Chriſt you do own dearly, &amp;c. Now here you come in again with your mental reſervation, ſaying you did not call the Church of Chriſt ſo, but the People in <hi>Briſtol,</hi> which you ſay is a Harlot; now is this honeſty or any thing elſe but deceit and hypocriſie: did not we ſend to admoniſh you, for calling this Church in <hi>Briſtol</hi> a Harlot, which you confeſs you did, and yet you ſay this charge is falſe, and from the Father of lies; we wonder who is your Father in this thing, and what appears in you but meer deceit and ſubtilty, equivocation, and mental reſervation; O! for ſhame lay aſide theſe unchriſtian practiſes; and here we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire all Chriſtians to conſider, whether this were a ſtudied and falſe accuſation, as you ſay.</p>
            <p>The fourth branch of your Admonition is, your aſſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Church Doctrins contrary to truth, three of which are mentioned, many more might have been, &amp;c. Firſt, you aſſerted at a Meeting in your own houſe, that as Chriſt was the great light of the World, ſo he was the great Faith of the World; and that Chriſt and Faith was all one, and that Chriſt was not the object of Faith: Our queſtion was not about the oneneſs or nearneſs that there is between Chriſt and Faith; but whether the perſon of Chriſt, and the grace of Faith were not to be diſtinguiſhed; and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Jeſus Chriſt in his perſon, as God-Man, be not the object of Faith, as him whom man is to believe in for Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation: Your aſſertion was, we did not know what Faith was, and that Faith was an eternal thing, alleging that
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:30607:13"/>
Scripture, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. laſt. <hi>But the things which are not ſeen are eternal.</hi> This occaſioned many Scriptures to be brought to prove that Chriſt and Faith were to be diſtinguiſhed, and that Chriſt was the object of Faith; and though the word object be not uſed in Scripture in that ſenſe, yet, we are often bid to look unto Chriſt for Salvation, as <hi>Iſa.</hi> 45. 22. <hi>Zach.</hi> 12. 10 <hi>Heb</hi> 12 2. which Scriptures were then alleged againſt what you aſſerted<hi>:</hi> Now in your Reply you allege 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 9 you ſay faith is a Miſtery held in a pure conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, hid from al ignorant and vulturous eyes, &amp;c. in which Reply of yours, you ſhew your weakneſs, in abuſing the words and ſenſe of the Apoſtle, as any judicious Chriſtian may perceive by comparing your Book with that Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, &amp;c. but upon the matter you do now ſay as much as we did then admoniſh you of. And whereas you demand why we did not then queſtion you, and that if it be for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience ſake, why had we not done it ſooner, and why had we not diſproved you by the Scripture, and why would we ſuffer things contrary to truth to be aſſerted among us without rebuke? &amp;c. We anſwer, you were preſently op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed and blamed for aſſerting ſuch things, as you were at ſeveral other times for aſſerting ſuch things, which in the 20 page of your Book, you call ſome manifeſtation of truth that was breaking forth in you ſome years paſt; at which ſome were offended, and contradicted it, &amp;c. though for a ſolemn dealing with you, we did not, till you left the Church; which perhaps was our ſin and your miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; but conſidering your ſpirit, and the ſtate of the Church, we knew not how to ſet about it, though ſome ſaw ground enough to do it, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The fifth branch of your Admonition, which was for ſpeaking againſt the Scriptures, affirming they were blind, and a plague to ſouls, and that they were not the Word of God, nor the Rule of Life, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>For the firſt part of this branch, you did, at a Meeting again at your own houſe, affirm, which many took notice of, as well thoſe that were not of the Church, as thoſe that were, whereby the thing was publickly known in the Citie, and became a reproach to the Church; an eminent
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:30607:13"/>
perſon of the Citie enquiring of one of us about it; and that you did ſpeak theſe words, is as certain as ever you did ſpeak word in your life, ſome of us ſitting over againſt you, do well remember with what kind of paſſion you ſpake it, clapping your hand upon the Book or Table, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that that Book or Scripture, was one of the greateſt blinds and plagues to mens ſouls this day in <hi>England;</hi> and theſe words became a reproach to the Church, upon which we did admoniſh you; and though now in your Book, you ſay that this charge is utterly falſe, and from the Father of lies, and invented by his inſtruments; yet we do again affirm, and will ſet our hands to it, that you did ſpeak theſe very words.</p>
            <p>Secondly, for that expreſſion, that the Scriptures are not the Word of God, &amp;c. did not you, at the red Lodge in the Gardenhouſe, before near twenty people, ſay ſo? when one of us being by, bid you for ſhame not to ſpeak ſo; it is true, you did at a Meeting a little before you left us, propoſe it to conſideration, as a thing wherein we had been miſtaken; yet ſo, as your very propoſing of it, did imply the negative: other inſtances alſo we could give at private conferences that ſome of us had with you about the ſame thing; but what need we ſay more, do you not demand in your Book, <hi>page</hi> 19. where doth the Scripture call it ſelf the Word of God? to which we anſwer, we ſhall give you four plain places inſtead of many, <hi>Jer.</hi> 30. 2, 4. <hi>Rev.</hi> 17. 17. <hi>Prov.</hi> 30. 5. <hi>Mark</hi> 7. 8, 9, 13. But what ſhould we go to light a candle to the Sun? have not many judicious and godly Writers long ago proved againſt former Athieſts and Hereticks, that the Scripture is the Word of God; though neither they nor we deny, that glorious Tittle, that God the Father hath put upon the perſon of Jeſus Chriſt, that his <hi>Name ſhould be called the Word of God, Rev.</hi> 19. 13.</p>
            <p>And thirdly, whereas you demand, to whom was the Scripture, the Rule of Life? We anſwer, to all the People of God to whom they were given, <hi>Deut.</hi> 4. 8. and 5 31, 32. <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 6. 7. <hi>chap. Rom.</hi> 12. All which containeth Rules and Directions for Chriſtians to walk by; but it is
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:30607:14"/>
the character of wicked men, that they caſt the Law of God behind their backs.</p>
            <p>And thus we have proved every tittle you are charged with in your Admonition, to be true and clear, ſo that we are no liars, nor falſe accuſers; but we muſt turn that back again upon your ſelf, profeſſing to all the World, that you have wronged us in what you have written againſt us.</p>
            <p>As for the other part of your Letter, wherein you ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times flatter your ſelf, and commend your ſelf, about your righteouſneſs, faithfulneſs, diligence and deſerving; as likewiſe how freely you had ſerved us, and been a keeper of our Vineyard, and that now it is time to look to your own Vineyard, and to mind your eternal habitation, &amp;c. We anſwer firſt, as <hi>Prov.</hi> 27. 2. <hi>Let another man praiſe thee and not thine own mouth, a ſtranger and not thine own lips:</hi> But we never did blame you, nor admoniſh you, for any good you did among us, but for your departing from that which was good; <hi>Jehu</hi> was not blamed for the good he did, but becauſe he took no heed to walk in the Law of the Lord God of <hi>Iſrael</hi> with all his heart; neither was <hi>Amaziah</hi> bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med for any good he did, but becauſe he did it not with a perfect or upright heart; and as for your gift of diſcerning, &amp;c. moſt of us know it was a thing you did much pretend to, and boaſt of, &amp;c. though we could obſerve your groſs miſtake therein, &amp;c. And for your now looking to your own Vineyard, and minding your eternal habitation, &amp;c. truly we hoped you had done that when you were among us, and that your care and diligence which now you ſpeak of, had been as well about your own ſoul as others: but if it were not, we wiſh you may make better uſe of your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent time, than you have done of that which is paſt: As for any manifeſtations of truth breaking forth in you as you ſay, <hi>page</hi> 20. at which ſome of our hearts burned, and others were offended, &amp;c. We know not any one Truth, that ever you ſpake in the Church, but it was readily aſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to, and ſeconded by thoſe that ſate by; whether you did preſs to believing or holy walking; but for other things which were not according to Scripture, nor did not tend to faith or holineſs, &amp;c. ſome of us did ſometimes manifeſt
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:30607:14"/>
our diſſent from you; yet with all tenderneſs, as knowing your ſpirit, and the ſpirits of ſome others now with you, we were not willing to offend you or them. And as for that which you ſo often aſſerted in the Church, and now mention <hi>page</hi> 20, 21. That you did not know Chriſt, and that that knowledge we had of him ſhould profit us no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and that our habitation is in deceit, and through it we refuſe to know the Lord, &amp;c. Firſt, we did not vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently oppoſe you in that thing, as thinking that it aroſe from a ſight and ſenſe of the want of the Spirit of Chriſt, to open and reveal the glory of his perſon, virtues, Offices, and Myſteries, more clearly unto you, according to what is written, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1. 17<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 18. <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 2. <hi>John</hi> 16. 14, 15. and herein we could and did joyn with you in complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the littleneſs or ſmalneſs of our knowledg of Chriſt; yet ſome of us did often tell you, that our comfort ſtood not ſo much in a ſpeculative knowing, as in a believing ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment of Chriſt, to be that which he is ſaid to be in the Scriptures, and ſo to own him, believe on him, love him, and obey him; and therefore we did then, and have ſince, and do now declare, that we owned no other Chriſt, but that one annointed glorious perſon, who was born of the Virgin, and who is made both Lord and Chriſt, who died, roſe, and aſcended, and is now ſitting at the right hand of God, and is the Mediator, between God and man, who ſhall one day come again, according to the Scriptures.</p>
            <p>Secondly, we do own no other knowing of Chriſt, but that which is according to the Scripture, namely, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandingly, to know him in his perſon without us, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perimentally to know him in his Virtues, or by his Spirit within us; and ſo through grace we do know him in our meaſure, and are waiting and praying daily for a further and clearer knowledge of him in his Virtues, and powers, by the revelation of his glorious Spirit, according to the Scripture; in the mean time we deſire to acknowledge him, believe on him, love and reverence him as our Lord and King<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and do ſubmit to his Laws and Commands leſt in his Word: but we did little think, that your meaning
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:30607:15"/>
had been as now you declare, both in your Book, and by your practice, that you and we ſhould take up that kind of notion of Chriſt, as to call that light that is in every man, both Heathens and others, <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and ſo to ſlight and nullifie that glorious perſon now in heaven, from being the object of Faith, &amp;c. as many of your way do and have done to ſome of our faces, ſcoffing and jeering at us for ſpeaking of the perſon of Chriſt, and for thinking to be ſaved by the blood of him that died at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and as you your ſelf did jeeringly ask one of this Congregation, to this effect; whether we did believe Chriſt to be an old man, ſitting in a chair in heaven? &amp;c. You further tell us, <hi>page</hi> 21. That many who deſired to ſee Chriſts firſt Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance in the fleſh became his betrayers and murderers; ſo now in his ſecond Appearances in life, power, and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, would be found the greateſt enemies to him, and that ſome of us would betray him; and then appeal to all that have any diſcerning to judge, how ſadly this is already ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled in us, &amp;c. We grant that many did ſtumble at Chriſt when he came in the fleſh, and that many in all ages have ſtumbled at the truth, and waies of Chriſt, as likewiſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny do now at his perſon, his Goſpel, his waies, and his Ordinances, &amp;c. which might put you to conſider two things: Firſt, whether you be not one that do ſo; and ſecondly, whether you be not one that have cauſed many to do ſo? &amp;c. But you ſeem to beg the queſtion, and take it for granted, that Chriſt is now come in life, power, and ſpirit, in you and your party; but truly you muſt give bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter demonſtrations of it, before we or any other judicious Chriſtians will believe you; for we have read much, and know ſomething by experience through grace, what the ſweet, gentle, &amp; dove-like ſpirit of Chriſt is, &amp; we have ſeen and known by ſad experience, how unlike your ſpirit is to that: Secondly, how can you call this a murdering and betraying of Chriſt, namely our ſending brethren three times in love and pitie to enquire after and admoniſh you and the reſt that departed from us? we ſhall leave this to the Lord to determine, &amp;c. As for thoſe ſtrange and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian expreſſions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>page</hi> 21. of our ſporting our ſelves,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:30607:15"/>
and making a wide mouth, and drawing out the tongue and the hand againſt you, &amp;c. and then calling us children of tranſgreſſion, a ſeed of falſhood, comparing of us to <hi>Iſhmael</hi> and <hi>Cain,</hi> &amp;c. We ſhall ſay little to it, onely deſire the Lord to rebuke your railing; yea, we ſay again, the Lord rebuke your railing. Have we done any thing to you or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt you, more than ſent three Brethren, (after many prayers made) for to ſeek to recover your ſoul. And as for our imagining a vain thing, and ſetting our ſelves, and taking counſel againſt the annointed one, (as you ſay) as likewiſe our joining in confederacy with the enemies of God, and that we muſt be broken to pieces, for the Lord of Hoſtes is with you, and the ſhout of a King is among you, &amp;c. We ſee it is an eaſie thing, for a man that hath brain-knowledge in the Letter of the Scriptures, to heap up a multitude of good words, right or wrong: but whether we or you have ſet againſt the annointed one, whether we or you ſhall be broken in pieces, we ſhall humbly leave to the Lord of Hoſtes, and King of Iſrael to determine, but we deny that the ſhout of the true King is among you, though ſome of your way have ſhouted and cried, <hi>Hoſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na, holy, holy, King of Iſrael,</hi> to <hi>James Naylor;</hi> and if you mean that King as they called him, &amp;c. we deſire with hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militie, to ſhout and rejoice: Firſt, that God hath through the riches of his grace preſerved us from thoſe ſtrong de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſions, that you and others are fallen under. Secondly, that the Lord hath ſo wonderfully diſcovered, the abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable wickedneſs of thoſe proud boaſters and blaſphemers, who called themſelves Apoſtles, and were owned by you as infallible; &amp; that God ſhould do it in this Citie, even in the very faces of you, that you might ſee it &amp; be aſhamed, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>You make mention in the 22. <hi>page,</hi> of ſome of us beat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in our Meetings, like the enemies of Chriſt in their Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagogue, &amp;c. Now as we cannot but wonder at your ſhameleſneſs in printing ſuch a thing; ſo we cannot but declare to all the world the truth of this ſtory. You know it hath been the practice of the Women of this Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for ſome years paſt, (eſpecially ſince the Apoſtacy of you and others from us) every ſecond day of the week,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:30607:16"/>
towards evening, to ſeek the Lord by ſupplication and prayer by themſelves; at which Satan hath much raged, and ſome of your way have come ſeveral times to diſturb them, and in particular upon the day you mention, there came two Women, one of which had been an old <hi>Ranter,</hi> but now fallen into your way, the other a late Member of this Church, but now turned to your opinion; theſe two wretched Women came ruſhing into the room, (one of our Siſters being then in prayer) and ſo did in a moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian, uncivil, and inhumane manner, walk up and down the room, humming and making a loud voice, at length came to the Woman that was in prayer, and putting their mouth to her ear, uttered theſe words, <hi>The prayer of the wicked is an abomination to the Lord;</hi> and ſo forced her to give over praying, whereupon after many civil intreaties by ſome, to cauſe them to depart, and to leave off telling them, that there was no place for them unleſs they would be quiet; but this not prevailing, one of the company, an ancient godly Woman, took one of them by the arm, and would have put her forth at the door, but could not, ſhe being too ſtrong for her; which ſtriving together, is that which you call a beating, and ſo at length the Woman of the houſe, claiming her privilege, did command them to depart; and this was all the beating and occaſion of it, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Now let all the world ſee the wretched wickedneſs of theſe two women which you juſtifie: Secondly weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and ſhallowneſs of your foundation upon which you build your large Diſcourſe of 11 or 12 lines together where you heap up many dreadfull expreſſions againſt this Church for this act, calling it a beating like the enemies of Chriſt in the Synagogue; whereas there was but 5 or 6 wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men there<hi>:</hi> now is not this to juſtifie the wicked and condemn the rightous both of which are an abomination to the Lord? as <hi>Prov.</hi> 17. 15. what more wicked act could there be than for theſe two wretched women to come huming, ranting, and roaring into the room, to diſturb a company of poor Chriſtians when they were ſeriouſly powring forth their Soules to God in prayer? &amp;c. You deſire us page 22. to read without prejudice or deceit the

83 <hi>Pſalm</hi> from end to end, and ſee whether our practiſe and portion be not contained in it &amp;c.

What groſs darkneſs hath ſeized upon your mind, that you ſhould be crying out againſt us, and threatning of us, for that which we through grace, are innocent of, and you your ſelf ſo notoriouſly found to practiſe, for are not you joined with all the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts, Athieſts, Ranters,</hi> and ungodly rabble of the world, in this one great deſign of the Devil, to break in pieces the Churches of Chriſt in <hi>England?</hi> Hath it not been the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of one power and party after another, to rout, break, and ſcatter the Congregations in <hi>England,</hi> under the name of <hi>Independents, Anabaptiſts, Sectaries,</hi> and <hi>Schiſmaticks?</hi> &amp;c. And hath any party gone ſo far in this wicked pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, as you and your company, that call themſelves <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers</hi> have done?

            <head>A Reply of the three Meſſengers of the Church, to an untrue Charge or Report of <hi>Dennis Holliſter,</hi> in a little Pamphlet called, <hi>The Skirts of the Whore diſcovered.</hi>

               <salute>Dennis Holliſter,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>BEfore we make our defence to your paſſionate, hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, untrue report of us, we ſhal ſet down in order the Churches order, &amp; our commiſſion from God by them, to admoniſh your ſelf and many others in your caſe, <hi>Viz.</hi> The Church taking into conſideration, the great diſhonor brought to the Name of God, the publick ſcandals and reproches caſt upon the wayes of Jeſus Chriſt, to the wounding and piercing of him afreſh, and to the grieving of the hearts of many pretious Saints, ſtumbling the weak, and opening the mouthes of the adverſaries.</p>
            <p>We, the whole Church, do again the ſecond time, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Scripture rule, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. 15<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to the 20. <hi>Tit.</hi> 3 10, &amp;c. in the name of the Lord <hi>Ieſus</hi> our Saviour, and in tender bowels of pitie, and love to your ſouls, beſeech, admoniſh and warn you to repent of your ſins, and refrain from your evil ways, and to return to the truth, faith, and ways of the Lord <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> recorded in the Goſpel, that if it be poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, the glory of God may be recovered, reproches, ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals and ſtumbling-blocks removed, our ſouls refreſhed, and your ſoul eternally ſaved, which is the deſire and end
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:30607:18"/>
of the Church, in the performance of this their duty to the Lord, and ſervice to your ſouls.</p>
            <p>We do alſo appoint and deſire three of our brethren, <hi>viz. Robert Simpſon, Richard Moon, Robert Purnel,</hi> to admoniſh them, to whom we ſhall give the particular things to admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh each perſon of, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>We the three Meſſengers of the Church above named, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving knowledge of the Churches order, and having received our Commiſſion from God by them as to this work. We three only met together, and conſidered ſeriouſly of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars that we were to admoniſh our back-ſlidden brethren and ſiſters of. Moſt of which we knowing our ſelves they were guilty of, and for thoſe things we knew not our ſelves, we were fully ſatisfied by the mouthes of many faithful true witneſſes, that were eye and ear-witneſſes to the reſt; ſo we being fully ſatisfied in every particular, we did in the name of the Lord, and in obedience to his command, in a filiall fear to God, love and pitie to your ſouls, admoniſh one after another as we had opportunity, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Now <hi>Dennis Holliſter,</hi> you have falſly accuſed us in your pamphlet, <hi>pag.</hi> 3. in ſaying we charged you with falſe accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations, and as ſoon as we had done, fled away as men ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized with fear, or accuſed by their own conſciences, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>For the firſt of theſe, that the things we charged you with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all are true in every ſyllable of it, doth at large appear in the fore-going anſwer to the whole Church: and for the ſecond, whereas you ſay, as ſoon as we had done, that we fled away as men ſurprized with fear, or accuſed by our own conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, &amp;c. this is as falſe as the reſt, for through grace we did not fear you, neither did our conſciences accuſe, but excuſe us in what we did, as being then, and ſtill are, fully ſatisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed we had done that which was our duty; Now if you will know the reaſon why we did not ſtay with you after we had done our work with you, then let us tell you that you may remember when we were ſent by the Church with the firſt admonition, ſome of us ſtaid with you above an hour, and found your ſpirit in ſuch an ill frame even as a boyling Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace boyling over, and ſcalding all that ſtand near it; this
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:30607:18"/>
made us reſolve in the ſtrength of Chriſt, not to ſtay ſo with you the ſecond time, unleſs we could diſcern your ſpirit to be in a better frame<hi>:</hi> but as ſoon as we perceived you not to hear the Meſſengers of the Church, but in ſtead thereof we diſcerned ſome violent headineſs breaking forth, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, &amp;c. So we left you as one not in a capacity for Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians to converſe withall. Much more we might ſay, but we judge your tongue or pen can be no ſlander to us, as to any ſerious Chriſtians, our ſtability as to all ſubſtanciall principles of religion, being as well known as your muta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility. We ſubſcribe this with our hands.</p>

            <p>I Intend by the grace of God to forbear giving like for <note place="margin">Mat. 5. 38. to the end. Luke 6. 27, 28, 29. Rom. 12. 17. to 22. Heb. 12, 15.</note> like, an eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth, reproach for reproach, through the infinite abounding grace of God extended to me by Chriſt, in ſome meaſure I have learned otherwiſe.</p>
            <p>And your cenſorious bitter language, and judging with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, nay againſt the Rule which God hath ſet as bounds for us not to paſs over; in which judgings of yours you climb up as high as the Temple of God, I ſhall ſay little, or but ſmall, to you about, but in reference to that ſeriouſly conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der theſe places, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2. 1 to 13. <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 4, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13.

Iſal. 30. 1.</note> ſeem not to diſcern it, but cover it with a covering that is not of Gods Spirit, and ſo add ſin to ſin, and the good Lord give you repentance for it, you have not hurt or injured me at all by it, though your ſelf you do; God hath of his infinite goodneſs, made your hard falſe ſpeeches, and cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorious
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:30607:19"/>
judgings of me, of good uſe to me, though no thanks at all to you for it nor any thing but what is ſad to think on can you reap from it.</p>
            <p>As I have ſaid to you ſomtimes upon the like occaſion, when you affirmed unto me that ſome men, to wit, ſuch as then you had in admiration, though for that in which they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded, or God owns above others, I never ſaw nor yet heard, but this you affirmed to me concerning them, that when they were in the light, they could ſee what mens in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſtates was before God; ſome of which as you ſaid, they ſaw you named to me, though ſuch as they never ſaw, <note place="margin">Matth. 7. 16. 19, 20, 1 Cor. 4. 5. Deut. 29. 22.</note> nor yet heard of any thing viſibly apparently evill by them; by which man, by the bleſſed Rule of the Scriptures of truth, is to judge: otherwiſe our rule is to judge nothing before the time, until the Lord come, who will both bring to light the hidden things of darkneſs, and will make manifeſt the counſels of the hearts; and then ſhal every man have praiſe of God.</p>
            <p>My anſwer then to you in that affirmation concerning <note place="margin">Iſai. 8. 20. 1 Cor. 4 4. Job 10, 15. 2 Cor. 10. 17, 18. 2 Cor. 5. 9.</note> them, was this in words, or to the ſame effect, that as I could give no credence to ſuch aſſertions groundedly, but contrarily had more than ground of jealouſie to be ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious they were deluſions, as all ſuch things and pretended revelations be, which have not the Law and the Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny to warrant them: So what if all the men in the world, did approve me, what is that in order to certain ground of holding up my head before God in reference to it? So, if all did diſapprove me, yet upon, &amp; from ſuch a ground, as that I have a ſure word, &amp; certain witneſs of Gods approving of me, I ſhould not flagg in my Spirit, nor hang down in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to that. That uſe (beſides others) as to my ſelf I have endeavoured to make of thoſe great charges you lay upon me; and if your conſiderations Were otherwiſe of me, as ſometimes it hath been, and alſo of others, I would not in <note place="margin">Phil, 3. 3.</note> the leaſt heed or give any regard to it, ſo as to fleſh my ſelf from it, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 3.</p>
            <p>The charges indeed that you lay upon me, and ſend me cloathed with before the world, if ſo indeed, how ſad were my condition; well might my countenance be changed, and
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:30607:20"/>
my thoughts be troubleſome unto me, and the joynts of my loyns be looſed, and my knees ſmite one againſt another, as if I did inhabit deceit, and deviſe wicked imaginations, and ſpeak lies to you, and that in the name of the Lord, and the like. Sore charges they be, wickedneſs of the higheſt degree, and of the dangerouſeſt attendance that can be.</p>
            <p>But truly it is ſufficient to me, that under all the charges you load me with, that I have alwayes a witneſs in heaven, <note place="margin">Rom. 8. 33, 34. Pſal. 3. 3, 4, 5. Job 34. 29.</note> and brought into my own heart from thence, and confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med unto me by the Spirit of truth, which proceedeth from the Father and the Son, by which I am cleared of your char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and ſo by that means they take no hold upon me, God <note place="margin">To wit, your own private ſpirit and conſideration, 2 Pet. 1. 20, 21.</note> gives me much caſe under all your clamors. Truly, it is a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſmall matter to me to be judged of you, (I ſay of you) who are more than apt to judg all, both perſons and things, to be light, that bears no weight in your Ballance.</p>
            <p>By which Ballance I know you muſt not your ſelf be weighed at the great day and appearing of the Lord <hi>Ieſus:</hi> but by that Ballance or Rule, that who ever walk according to it, peace and mercy ſhal be upon them; the Word that <note place="margin">John 12. 48.</note> Chriſt hath ſpoken muſt judge all at that day.</p>
            <p>But truly <hi>Dennis Holliſter</hi> I pitie thee, me thinks I could even mourn over thee in the conſideration of thy being in <note place="margin">Rev. 12 10. Luke 3. 14. Mat 12 43, 44</note> the Divels work and imployment, to wit, an accuſer of the brethren, as I am ſure thou art in thy printed Papers.</p>
            <p>And for that falſe charge (as it is altogether) of my ſpeaking lies to you in the name of the Lord.</p>
            <p>That charge of yours, I know, hath reference to my be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (as you ſlightly ſay) the mouth of three Meſſengers ſent to you by the Church to admoniſh you of your ſins, (which ſins of yours I am ſure was obvious, viſible and clear.) Truly in order to that, I knew well what I ſpake, <note place="margin">Mat. 28. 18. Mat. 18. 16, 17, 18.</note> when I ſpake on that rate I did unto you. I with my bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren that came with me, had a Warrant ſealed and given forth to us from him who hath all power given unto him in Heaven and Earth, for what we did. And if I may ſpeak it without boaſting, as I truſt I do, ſo we did at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt it, as thoſe that God had vouchſafed that grace
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:30607:20"/>
unto, to take up into the Mount with him, to confer with his Majeſty by Chriſt about it, before we did dare to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt upon it, his Majeſty being pleaſed graciouſly to incline our hearts in ſome meaſure of holy reverence, feare and trembling, and in faith to wait upon his Majeſty by Chriſt our Mediator and Iuterceſſor, and we had a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious anſwer from him by Chriſt, to our very hearts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it. And ſo we are ſtrenthened to that work of the Lord, which otherwiſe we had rather any had been <note place="margin">Exod. 3. 11. Jer 6. 7, 8, 9,</note> ſent about than we. And then we went not ſtaggering<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, nor yet ignorantly, but knowingly and underſtanding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly about it, God having in ſome meaſure fitted us for it, and left us not without ſome ſure witneſs, that he was with us in it.</p>
            <p>And not any reluctancie have I or my brethren had for what we did; but are fully ſatisfied that what ever was ſet upon you, and laid at your door as your ſin, to a tittle <note place="margin">Iſal. 28, 17.</note> is true, and will be ſo found when the Lord ſhall lay Judgment to the Line, and Righteouſneſſe to the Plum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met, and the hail ſhall ſweep away the refuge of lies, and the waters ſhall overflow the hiding-place.</p>
            <p>And whereas you ſay in the firſt line of your Letter to me, that it came upon you in ſoberneſs to manifeſt to my conſcience, a little of the deceit in which as you ſay I inhabit.</p>
            <p>That it came upon you to write to me, that is not <note place="margin">Jer. 17. 9, 10. 1 Tim. 1. 4, 5, 6, 7. 1 Tim. 4. 7. 2 Tim. 2, 16, 17, 23.</note> queſtoned, but did it indeed come upon you in ſoberneſs, look back, recall your ſelf, it's poſſible you may be miſtaken, is it not?</p>
            <p>The occaſion of your writing of it (which I would here relate, but that then I ſhould be too tedious as wel as be of little uſe to the Reader as all ſuch Diſcourſes uſually be) the tumult and heat which you gave a clear manifeſtation of but a little before you writ and ſent it, may give, I ſay, at leaſt a reall ground of jealouſie, that it came not from a Spirit in a ſober frame at that time.</p>
            <p>And ſure when you are come to your ſelfe, as I may
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:30607:21"/>
ſay, into a ſober mind, you will not ſay it came upon you in ſoberneſs to write what you did, and when you did write; ſure were you not in that altogether a ſtranger at home, you would charge upon your ſelf paſſionate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, even this, that the occaſion of your writing of that, and moſt, if not all that you writ and ſent abroad con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning others; came from a fire indeed kindled in you, but not from a Cole from off the Altar, but from a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent heat of wild-fire that came upon you, and was then in you, by which you were hurried, and in that hurry you writ and ſent it.</p>
            <p>Sure that ſoberneſs that is put into the heart by God, which is one of thoſe good and perfect gifts that cometh <note place="margin">Jam. 1. 17. Jam. 3. 17, 18, 13, 14, 15. Gal. 5, 22, 23.</note> from above, and cometh down from the Father of lights, is juſt as that Wiſdom is which cmometh down from above, which is firſt pure, then peaceable, eaſie to be intreated, gentle, full of mercy and good works, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out partiality and without hypocriſie.</p>
            <p>If that ſoberneſs you ſpeake of were of that nature, <note place="margin">1 Sam. 15. 13, 14. Phil. 4. 5.</note> or had that ſtamp upon it, how comes it to paſs, that, that which you ſay came upon you in ſoberneſs to write, had ſo little (if any thing at all) of that Wiſdom that is from above in it. That moderation that the Apoſtle ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horts Saints to make known to all men, nothing at all of that in your printed paper, clearly manifeſts to any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different, ſober, unbyaſſed man; but moſt (if not all of it) o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>otherwiſe.</p>
            <p>And ſure that which you ſay came upon you in ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berneſs to manifeſt, had little of any thing at all of that Wiſdom that is from above, which in order to the ſame is firſt pure; but indeed that which is poynt blank con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to purity of hearts, to true ſpeaking, was it ſtuft withall. And ſo I come to ſpeak and give a true An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer.</p>
            <p>I deſire with that which is reall ſoberneſs indeed, to the main thing in your Letter to me, in reference to which you ſo ſport your ſelfe, and inſult over me as a Lyar, and ſo preſent me before all, as one that ſhall have his

part in the Lake that burneth with fire and brimſtone, <note place="margin">Rev. 22. 15. Rev. 21. 7, 8.</note> which is the ſecond death.</p>
            <p>Whereas indeed not any thing at all was a lye in what I aſſerted, but what I ſaid you had my Hand unto, as my particular affirmation, that I ſay ſtill, and that groundedly and truly you cannot manifeſt, much, leſs have you any ground at all to lay that upon me which makes a lye, or any other ſin, out of meaſure ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, in order to the aggravations of it, (to wit) that it was a Lie invented, a Lie proſecuted, a Lie denied, and a Lie proved upon me; which words you ſay to me in the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted letter to me: Sure you were not in a ſober mind when you ſaid ſo, I am ſure of that, but a great diſtance from it and true ſpeaking.</p>
            <p>And I cannot but think if you did indeed commune with your own heart, that light that is in you, and is in all men, if not put cut, it would tell you ſo, and that it is a very ſlender proof that you have of it.</p>
            <p>I could wiſh that in plainneſs and ſingleneſs of heart you had put out that Letter you have under my hand from end to end, as you did the Letter you ſent to me, but that is forborn by you; for what end you beſt know<hi>:</hi> but had it ſo been, I know you had not gained any thing at all by it, to be a proof of what you would charge upon me. Had you in <hi>Simplicity,</hi> and <hi>godly honeſty</hi> with it, declared how you came by it, and upon what account it was given unto you, which for ſatisfaction to the Reader, I ſhall truly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late.</p>
            <p>You know that after I, with my brethren, had endeavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to ſet your ſins upon you, and to admoniſh you for them<hi>:</hi> afterwards I meeting with you, or rather as I think, you calling of me in to ſpeak with you as I went by your ſhop, you deſired of me a Copie of the Churches charge of ſin, that I with my brethren did admoniſh you for, from the Church, (which, ſaid you to me, I know you have a Copie of) I was not free and forward to do it as you did well perceive; not as if I was unſatisfied of the warantableneſs of the doing of it; I was ſatiſfied, I might, though I told you
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:30607:22"/>
then, I could not do it as from the Church, I being but a ſingle perſon<hi>:</hi> But that way wardneſs that was in me of gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving you a copie of the Churches charge of your ſins, ſprang from ſome jealouſies that I had, that you would but your ſelf with it, becauſe of that fierce violent ſpirit that was manifeſted from you againſt your Reprovers, and that obdurateneſs that lay upon you.</p>
            <p>Yet with your more than once or twice perſwading of me with importunity and intreaty, I did engage my ſelf to you to write out a copie, of what the Church by us did charge as ſin upon you; which I did truly, and deliver to you<hi>:</hi> and yet it was both promiſed and delivered to you, with this engagement, and actuall promiſe on your part, which I bound you to that you ſhould not make uſe of it, for the making of that breach wider, that the wicked one by his Inſtruments had made here, I at that time ſaying theſe words to you, or to that effect, <hi>I am ſure that I would be loath to be found a ſetter up of partition walls, I had rather God would make all his people diligent, mindfull and carefull, of minding the things that make for peace, and by which we might edifie one another.</hi> Which you gave me a promiſe of; how clearly and fully you have broken your promiſe and perſonall engagement, you cannot be ignorant, unleſs wilfully ignorant.</p>
            <p>So according to my promiſe to you, to which I was made more forward then elſe I ſhould have been by your ſolemn promiſe,, I brought you a true copie of the charge of the whole Church of your ſin, not any one of them but did agree in it, and did alſo agree to ſend us with it; but the copie that I brought you, I did not bring it ſigned then with my hand at it, for indeed I was jealous of your ſpirit, notwithſtanding your promiſe, who will wring and ſcrew out of words that which they ſpeak not, and which thoſe that ſpeak them, intend not,</p>
            <p>Which was the cauſe I had not then ſet my hand to it<hi>:</hi> but you looking at it, and ſeeing my hand was not then to it, you intreated me to ſet my hand to it, that it was a true Copie of the Churches Charge of thoſe ſins,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:30607:22"/>
for which I, with my brethren from them, did admoniſh you, I not conſidering what end you had in it; which was, it appears, to make me a tranſgreſſor before all: in that your own conſcience cannot but tell you I was clear, you tendring me a pen with ink in your ſhop, with the Copie I brought to you, I ſet my hand to it.</p>
            <p>And what did I ſet my hand to? you know, ſpeak truth, deal plainly and ſingly, do not evade and equivocate, though too much you have of that in your printed paper, in that you do profeſs you own Baptiſm and the Lords Supper, or breaking of Bread, as Inſtitutions and Ordinances of Chriſt, whilſt it is viſible to all that have eyes, that in your oxning of them you give no anſwer at all to thoſe that upon good grounds queſtion you about them (juſt ſo you deal with me) you know that what I ſet my hand to, was that; that which I delivered to you, was a true Copie of the Churches Charge, and that is all that you have my hand to, in reference to which you make ſuch a noyſe all over, in order to which there is meerly by you the ſounding of braſs, and the tinkling of the Cymball, onely the bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the aire. But to wind up this troubleſome diſcourſe, as to me it is, in which I would have been altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſilent, if not, drawn and put upon it by weighhty con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations.</p>
            <p>I ſhall propoſe this before you, take it and conſider of it.</p>
            <p>Say it be thus; That apparent injury and violence is offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to you in that which is near and dear unto you, ſay your neareſt relations, or to your name and eſtate, which I conceive you would preſerve and reſcue to your power, by all lawfull means, from thoſe forces that is put upon them, and injuries done to them, you being really ſatisfied with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any the leaſt ſcruple or queſtion, that ſuch violence and injury is done to them though your ſelf was not perſonally preſent and ſaw all done, though the moſt part of it you did; yet you being ſo clearly ſatisfied about that part you ſaw not, that the fact in every part of it, is as clear to you as the Sun at Noon-day. Now if in this caſe of yours that
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:30607:23"/>
doth ſo nearly concern you<hi>:</hi> you ſhould go; and from thoſe from whom you could not have the leaſt ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pition from, of ſpeaking otherwiſe than right in every Tittle.</p>
            <p>And from thoſe from whom you are ſo fully ſatisfied, <note place="margin">Deut. 17. 6. Deut. 19. 15. Mat. 18. 16.</note> beſides the teſtimony of many ſtanders by, about two or three Witneſſes by which the matter is eſtabliſhed.</p>
            <p>I ſay, in this caſe ſhould you go in a ſober and Chriſtian way, and tell ſuch as have done that injury, and put that vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence upon you of it, and debite the matter with them, tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of them they were much out of the way; they were injurious in what they did, and the end of it without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, would be very ſad and lamentable. Do you think that in this caſe fair &amp; even dealing were meaſured out unto you in caſe you ſhould be rendred as a Lyer all over the nation for it, becauſe you did not ſee it every bit your ſelf, though the moſt part of it you did; and what little part you did not, you had certain reall true teſtimonie of, not to be queſtioned? I judge you would not.</p>
            <p>This is the naked reall caſe I conceive between you and I, in reference to that for which you ſo fouly fall upon me, and tell me for it in your printed paper, that I am without, and for the Lake, and have a proud look, and a lying tongue, and a heart that deviſeth wicked imaginations, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the Lord hates, and ſay I have uttered perverſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and as the falſe witneſs ſhall not go unpuniſhed. Whilſt I ſpake nothing but what was true in every Tittle of it, and could not for bear to ſpeak, but with the making of my ſelf guilty of your ſin, having that clear <note place="margin">Lev. 5. 1. Lev. 19. 17.</note> Call to ſpeak it which I had, the moſt part of it being that, which to my grief I heard my ſelf, and that which I did not hear, I was fully ſatisfied of by true, clear, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quſtionable proof. I would leave this to you to make appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of, as in order to that, that yo write in your Letter concerning me.</p>
            <p>But, ſure I am, you did offer apparent violence and injury to that which ſhould be nearer and dearer to us than our neareſt relations, much more our names and eſtates.
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:30607:23"/>
I ſaw and heard it, almoſt all the particulars you were char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with; that which I did not hear, I wanted not ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in.</p>
            <p>Now being called to put to my hand with others, to ſee if I could be a means to recover you out of the ſnare of the Divel, and the pretious Inſtitutions of Chriſt from thoſe forces and violences that you offered to them<hi>:</hi> judg right; am I, think you, for this to be blamed? you do, it is true, but I paſs not for it, if that make me vile, as to you it doth, I reſolve to be more vile.</p>
            <p>So that by what I have ſaid as to your great charge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt me, I ſland clear, and never had you my hand in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, to that which I ſaid, I heard not, &amp; you well know it your own ſelf, though I ſaid I was not there when you ſpake ſo reproachfully of the bleſſed Scriptures of Truth; yet I ſaid I did believe it, and yet do; and you know you had not my hand to any thing but this, that, that which I delivereed to you at your your requeſt and ſolicitation, was a true copie of that the Church ſent us to admoniſh you for; if it be not, prove that, and then I ſhall own the condemnation as juſt, that you lay upon me for being a Liar, which I knowingly know you cannot, and tell that <note place="margin">Rom. 2. 1, 2, 3</note> you ſay nothing at all in order to your great charge<hi>:</hi> but only quibble at words, catching to get ſome hold ſo of me, but cannot.</p>
            <p>Beſides, it was ſome good ſpace of time after you had that, you have my hand to, ere you did pick any quarrell with me about it, though if you had pleaſed you might have ſpoken with me everie day, I think, in my paſſing to and fro<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or at the leaſt word of yours ſent to me to deſire it, and, I judge, I ſhould not have denied it.</p>
            <p>But I conceive you had not ſpoke when you did, but that you were heared by that fire that is ſure from beneath by my conteſting againſt that held out by you, which I deſire to war againſt by the Spirit and ſpirituall weapons, ſo long as I have any being, and not otherwiſe, as being fully ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied <note place="margin">Rom. 6. 13. 2 Cor. 10. 4, 5, 6.</note> that onely ſuch a war, of that kind and nature, is to be maintained; the wrath of man and carnal weapons not
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:30607:24"/>
being appointed of God, and ſo not under a promiſe of <note place="margin">2 Theſſ 2. 8. 2 Tim. 2. 24, 25, 26. 1 Tim. 1. 18, 19. 1 Sam. 17. 45. 47. 50. Rev. 12 7, 8, 9, 11.</note> a bleſſing from him, to bring down and to naught ſuch wickedneſs. And indeed I am clearly and in ſome meaſure ſatisfied by God, from that moſt ſure word of propheſie, whereunto we do well to take heed, that one main cauſe why the Lambs Warriours and Souldiers gain no more ground than they do againſt the Lambs and their enemies and oppoſers, both thoſe enemies within, and thoſe ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies they combat withall without, is becauſe ſuch conteſts and combats with them, the war is ſo little maintained by the Spirit and ſpiritual weapons, which if it were, ſure they would ſhe and fall before them.</p>
            <p>And immediatly after you have ſubſcribed the Letter you ſent me, in the third line of the next page you ſay con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning your Letter that you ſent me, you have received no anſwer of me; this is true, but did I promiſe to ſend you an anſwer? If ſo, you might charge me home, which I know you would not ſpare: But I did not, neither indeed could you groundedly expect any anſwer from me of it, if in a ſober mind<hi>:</hi> but yet that had been done, but that the bearer, by whom you ſent the Letter to me, by ſome thing that he propoſed to me, which had weight in it, did per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade me not to meddle in ſuch vain fruitleſs janglings, as to that effect ſome of his words was to me, by which I was detained from writing to you; and indeed his counſell in that was ſound and ſavourie,</p>
            <p>And whereas you mention that <hi>Feſtus,</hi> a Heathen <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Governor, was ſo noble, that he heard <hi>Pauls</hi> defence, as to the accuſation made againſt him by his own Countrey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men; and King <hi>Agrippa</hi> ſaid, Thou art permitted to ſpeak for thy ſelf<hi>:</hi> but, ſay you, you are falſly accuſed, condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and refuſed to make your defence.</p>
            <p>Firſt, I ſay, you are not falſly accuſed, condemned and refuſed to make your defence, that is but your own ſaying, it is a meer a rie vapour.</p>
            <p>Secondly, were you not deſired, nay intreated to come and appear, and ſo if you had any thing to ſay, to ſpeak and make your defence? Do you not wel know, that libertie
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:30607:24"/>
was never denied unto you? but what ground, I pray you, hath one in your caſe to expect the making his defence that way you would do, by a <hi>Proxes,</hi> as I may ſay, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing to come face to face, as <hi>Paul</hi> did before <hi>Agrippa</hi> and <hi>Feſtus,</hi> that you know you were intreated and deſired to do, and therefore in your naming of them in order to that you name them for, you ſpeak nothing at all; you were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to do it as they were and might have done, as <hi>Paul</hi> did; and I hope that groundedly; an evener Rule, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther kind of dealing had you found than what <hi>Paul</hi> was tried by, or he found from them, though I know you are more than apt to conclude otherwiſe of all that is not of your ſtature; but I fear ſenſe of guilt lay ſo open upon you, as that if you ſpeak truth, that was it that kept you away from making your defence in that way, that was clear by that Rule, we are to go by in the managing of the things of Gods Houſe, and ſo not any would have denied or excepted againſt you in a warrantable way, which you had free li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to do; and then before your ſelf, it not falling down under the ſins charged upon you: all in every particular had been proved, ſo as that you could not juſtly have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted againſt the Charge in no part of it; and I believe that would have been done by ſome of thoſe, if not all, for whoſe ſakes, as you ſay, you made that you ſent, and was not read viſibly.</p>
            <p>So ſimple honeſt hearted they were, and ſo remain, as that they, to ſave you out of the ſnare of the Divel, would have in ſoberneſs of Spirit, in conſcience of their duty to God, and in love to your ſoul, witneſſed before you that which was charged upon you.</p>
            <p>But I forget my ſelf, now a true Anſwer you have of all that Letter which in particular you ſent to me, with a ſmall <note place="margin">Iſal. 43. 2. 1 Pet. 4. 19. 1 Pet. 2. 15. &amp; 3. 1. 16. Pſal: 37, 5,</note> touch upon ſome thing, that in order to the not ſending you an anſwer you ſpeak to me afterward, I confeſs I have more words in my anſwer than I would or intended. But I could not tell how plainly to anſwer it ſo, as to ſatisfie the Reader in a briefer way.</p>
            <p>It is probable a flood you will caſt after me, but I paſs
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:30607:25"/>
not, ſuch floods ſhall not drown me, nor ſuch fire burn me; I reſolve, in the ſtrength of Chriſt, in the way of wel doing, to commit my ſelf to him who in this I know will bring forth my righteouſneſs as the light, and my judgement as the noon-day, and ſo to labour, by well doing, to put you to ſilence in this, as not knowing any way otherwiſe better to do it. And for your ſelf, I have, if my heart deceive me not, no coar at all againſt you; but could be glad I might be of any uſe unto you, and could rejoyce to ſee God recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of you out of the ſnare of the Divel, by giving of you repentance to the acknowledging of the truth, the which I am ſure you are departed from; which is the groans of your Friend, who is a lover of your Soul, though a Witneſs againſt your falſhood and deceit.</p>

            </opener>
            <p>I Have of late met with a Book put forth by you, in which there is a Letter formerly written by you to me, which Letter I acknowledge I received above a year ſince; and having read it, I laid it by, intending never to have Anſwered you, <hi>leſt</hi> (as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>Prov.</hi> 26. 4.) <hi>I alſo ſhould be like unto you:</hi> but now you having publiſhed it (with your folly) to the world, I take my ſelf bound to Anſwer you, <hi>leſt as</hi> (Prov. 26. 5.) <hi>you ſhould be wiſe in your own conceit, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the ſecond Branch of your Title page, you ſay, That I have before ſeveral witneſſes often denied my ſelf to be a Miniſter of the Goſpel; in which you deal like your ſelf, though not like a friend, nor like a Chriſtian: but as for your ends in ſo publiſhing, I ſhall leave to him by whom Actions and Spirits are weighed, who will preſerve the faithful, and plentifully reward the proud doer.</p>
            <p>I ſhall therefore with all plainneſs, ſoberneſs, and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, declare (both unto your ſelf, and alſo to the world) upon what grounds, and in what ſenſe, I have ſometimes denied to be called <hi>Miniſter,</hi> though I never denied my ſelf a Preacher of the Goſpel.
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:30607:26"/>
But the firſt ground upon which I denied the title of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter, was this; When you with, many others, as I ſhall farther ſhew, had prevailed with me to come to <hi>Briſtol,</hi> I gave it under my Hand to the Mayor, Aldermen, and Commiſſioners, That I ſhould not come as a Pariſh Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter to take any Parochial Charge upon me, but rather as a Publike Preacher of the Goſpel in the City, by way of Lecture, and ſo I have (ſometimes by word, ſometimes by writing, as I had occaſion) denied my ſelf to be a Miniſter of any Pariſh in <hi>Briſtol;</hi> ſo that I never did, nor I hope never ſhall own my ſelf a Miniſter of any Pariſh, &amp;c. ſo that this is the firſt ground, and this you know in your Conſcience to be true, and that I did it in tenderneſs of Conſcience, though now you make it matter of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach.</p>
            <p>Secondly, I have ſometimes (as it is like in your hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and ſome others) denied my ſelf a Miniſter in Office, I having not then been Called, Conſtituted, or Ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to any Office in any Church otherwiſe than by the una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimous Conſent, Approbation, and Requeſt of this Church of <hi>Briſtol,</hi> to ſerve them in the Lord, as that other godly man who left the City at my coming hither had done be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore me, I alwayes diſtinguiſhing, between a Perſon ſent forth to preach the Goſpel to the World, and a Perſon Called, ſet apart, and Ordained to Office in a Church: whether this diſtinction were right or no, I ſhall not now diſpute, but this was your judgement then, and therefore in this you deal unworthily in publiſhing this to the world, to my reproach, whereas you know in your Conſcience, that I never denied my ſelf to be a Preacher of the Goſpel, nor a Miniſter, or Servant to this Church, but only that I was not a Miniſter by Office, at leaſt by an actual, and ſolemn Ordination.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, There is yet another ground (as the Lord on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, who is the ſearcher of hearts knows) upon which I have often put off, that honour and dignity, when you and others have put that ſtile or title upon me, my heart hath ſecretly anſwered, What am I that I ſhould be called
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:30607:26"/>
ſo, I being a poor inconſiderable worm, the leaſt in my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers houſe: which have often brought thoſe words to my mind, <hi>Amos</hi> 7. 14 <hi>I was no Prophet, neither the Son of a Prophet, &amp;c.</hi> and this did ariſe from the ſenſe I had of the honour and dignity, weight and excellency of that high Calling, and the great unworthineſs and unfitneſs that I ſaw in my ſelf of ſo glorious an employment, and this alſo I am perſwaded you know in your Conſcience, that I have often hinted unto you in private diſcourſe, and when you have ſpoken of me, and to me, (more indeed than was fit for any wiſe man to ſpeak to the face of any Chriſtian) namely, what God had done in <hi>Briſtol</hi> by me ſince I came hither, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>But that I have been, and am through the grace of Chriſt (though the unworthieſt upon earth) yet a Preacher and publiſher of the glorious Goſpel, of the grace of God both in <hi>Wales,</hi> and now in <hi>Briſtol,</hi> I have no need to ſeek a proof of you, nor of any other man; I having had</p>
            <p>Firſt, The approbation, and recommendation of a Church of judicious Saints in <hi>London,</hi> where I had been for ſome time a Member, and unto whom my Principles as to matters of Religion, my Gift as to the work of Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, and my manner of life was well known.</p>
            <p>Secondly, I having been ſolemnly ſent forth by a Church of Chriſt in <hi>Wales,</hi> with Prayer and Supplication, recommending me to the Work and Grace of God, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing me to Preach the Goſpel in <hi>Wales,</hi> where, though I was accompanied with manifold weakneſſes and temptations, yet the Lord was pleaſed to give me ſome Seal of my Miniſtry, the lawfulneſs of which Call, and ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding forth to my work of Preaching, I could ſufficiently prove, both from Scripture, and from the practiſes of the Churches of Chriſt: but of that more hereafter.</p>
            <p>Now having continued Preaching in <hi>Wales</hi> about the ſpace of three years, it came to paſs that ſome Overtures were made by the people of this City for my coming hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and your ſelf, with a Miniſter then of this City came as Meſſengers to treat with the Church of <hi>Lannachas,</hi> in

               <hi>Wales,</hi> to ſpare me to this place, which though at firſt they denied, yet the importunity of many here (and as ſome have ſaid) the inceſſancy of Prayer prevailed, ſo that that Church did conſent that I ſhould come, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered that a Letter ſhould be written to acquaint the City and Commiſſioners, <hi>That if they could prevail with me, I ſhould come unto them, &amp;c.</hi> Whereupon as you know there was two Letters ſent unto me, the one from the City, ſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the then Major, ſome Aldermen, (one of which was then a Parliament man) with divers others of the Council, and Commiſſioners of the City of <hi>Briſtol,</hi> your ſelf being then one<hi>:</hi> Some of the words of which Letter I ſhall here inſert, &amp;c.</p>

            <p>Another large Letter I then received from divers god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly people, the inhabitants of the City, ſome of which words I ſhall alſo here inſert,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Dearly beloved, ſince after much waiting upon the Lord, the hearts of the People, generally throughout the City, is ſo much ſet upon you, deſiring to enjoy you in the ſervice of the Goſpel, &amp;c. And ſince our Motion formerly made by our Meſſengers, hath been ſo much proſpered by the Lord in the hearts of our Brethren there, &amp;c. We do therefore earneſtly and very ſeriouſly beſeech you in the Name of our Lord Jeſus, that you will with all convenient ſpeed come to</hi> Briſtol <hi>and help us, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Upon the receipt of which two Letters, and ſome ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe had with godly friends, I reſolved in the ſtrength and garce of Chriſt, That I would come, though I had much fear and trembling in my own heart, from the apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on I had of the greatneſs of the Work of Chriſt in <hi>Briſtol,</hi> and the inſufficiency I ſaw in my ſelf, ſo that it was not Riches, nor Honours that drew me hither, but meer Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:30607:27"/>
and Obedience to that Call, which I judged was of, and from the Lord; the thing having never been ſought or deſired by me, which hath much ſupported my Spirit under many tryals and temptations which I have met with ſince.</p>
            <p>But all this is little in compariſon of what I have yet (through grace) farther to ſpeak, and that is; That the Lord hath been pleaſed, through his goodneſs, to own me in my Work, ſo that though I am the unworthieſt in the world, yet I truſt I may ſay with a holy reverence, and humble boldneſs, that my record is on high, and that God hath given me a ſeal of my Miniſtry in <hi>Briſtol,</hi> there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing many Souls in this City that lay weltring in their bloud of ignorance, and ungodlineſs, when I came hither, that are now, through the riches of grace, made living and pretious ſtones, and are able to give to any man that ſhall ask them, a clear account, of the time when, the place where, the manner how, and the word and inſtrument by which the Lord was pleaſed to turn their Souls unto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, ſeveral of which are ſince received into this Church, and though they ſeem contemptible now in your eyes, and in the eyes of ſome others, yet I have good ground to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that they are pretious in the ſight of the Lord Jeſus, and will be found in him at his appearance.</p>
            <p>Likewiſe I doubt not but I have a teſtimony in your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience (though now it ſeem obliterated) that you have found by experience, that Chriſt was with me in my Work, and I am ſure I have often heard it from your mouth (if that were worth any thing) &amp;c.</p>
            <p>But I truſt there are hundreds in <hi>Briſtol,</hi> that can ſay, That the Lord hath been, and ſtill is, with my Miniſtry, quickning, comforting, teaching, and refreſhing their Souls, however you and others make it your work to tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce and reproach me, caſting contempt upon me, to weaken my hands, and ſadden my Spirit, and what in you and them lyeth, to diſcourage, and take off people from hearing of me; you ſaying to one in this City, <hi>That I Preach the Doctrine of Devils, &amp;c.</hi> And to another, <hi>That I</hi>
               <pb n="46" facs="tcp:30607:28"/>
               <hi>do wors hurt to your Way, than all the Preachers in</hi> Briſtol: Others cry me down as an <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurper, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncalled, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nlearned, Ignoramus &amp;c.</hi> And another in his late Book, loads me with <hi>Scoffs, Jeers, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>, &amp;c.</hi> which makes me won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, That you and they which are ſo different in other things, yet can all agree, to caſt ſtones at me, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements upon me, who never intended them or you any hurt, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>But, through grace, I find this by experience, That all your and their labour (as to this particular) is in vain, for the more you and they ſtrive to beat me down, and to caſt me out of the hearts of the people, the more room the Lord gives me in them, and the more proſperous and ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful, I truſt (and ſome think) my work is among them, through the help, grace, and goodneſs of my dear Lord Jeſus: I write this with lowlineſs and humility, without boaſting or vanity, to the praiſe of God, and to the ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the mouth of envie, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>It is true, I am no Preacher of that thing which you, and ſome of your way, call the Goſpel, namely, <hi>To bid every man turn to a Light within him:</hi> neither did I ever read, or hear, that any of the Prophets, Apoſtles, or holy men of God did preach ſuch a Goſpel, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>But that Goſpel of good newes and glad tydings, which Jeſus Chriſt gives commiſſion and commanded to be pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed and preached, to all Nations, and to every creature, that Goſpel I preach, and you have ſometimes born wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to me therein, though now your teſtimony be vailed, even the Goſpel of the grace of God, as <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 24. wherein the everlaſting love, grace, and good-will of God in Chriſt, is freely publiſhed and declared to poor loſt and one ſinners, and the way to eternal life by Jeſus Chriſt, through Faith in his bloud and righteouſneſs, &amp;c. this Goſpel I preach, preſſing all that receive it to give up themſelves to Chriſt in love and obedience, according to the ſcope and tenor of the Goſpel.</p>
            <p>But the great Argument by which you would prove me to be no Miniſter of the Goſpel is my ſpeaking, as you ſay,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:30607:28"/>
in the ſecond branch of your title page) of having <hi>Sarah Latchet</hi> whipt and ſent to Bridwel, &amp;c. Now that the Reader may be informed, and you, if poſſible, convinced of your weakneſs and folly in publiſhing this thing; I ſhall here faithfully relate the truth of that ſtory.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Sarah Latchet</hi> was ſometime a Member with the Baptized people in <hi>Briſtol,</hi> but Apoſtatizing from them, was Excommunicated by them, and ſo doth ſeem to have the greater hatred to, and rage againſt the truth, wayes, and people of Chriſt; this <hi>Sarah Latchet</hi> being one of the fierceſt ſort of the people who call themſelves <hi>Quakers,</hi> hath come ſeveral times to diſturbe us in our Meetings: I ſhall mention three times eſpecially.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Once in the publick Place after Sermon was done, ſhe fell a rayling at me, as their manner is, with fierce and cruel words, at which time ſhe was only turned out of the place, and nothing done to her.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Another time the Church being aſſembled to break Bread, and to celebrate the Lords Supper, this <hi>Sarah Latchet</hi> came into the place, I having ſpoken to the Church a word of Exhortation, in reference to that Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and addreſſing my ſelf to adminiſter it to the Church, this <hi>Sarah Latchet</hi> came ruſhing up towards the Table, and in the face of me, with a loud ſhrill voice be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan thus, <hi>O thou deceiver, the plagues of the eternal God, &amp;c.</hi> I ſpake not a word to her, but deſired the Church, to be ſtill in their ſpirits, and to mind the work in hand; one of our Brethren ſtept forth, and took her by the arm, and led her to the door, and put her forth; and this was all the hurt ſhe had at that time.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Another time, the Church being aſſembled, at the uſual time and place of Meeting, one of our Brethren being in Prayer, as ſoon, as ever he had done, ſhe being preſent in the room, did again with a loud ſhrill voice be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin thus, <hi>The Prayers of the wicked are abomination to the Lord, &amp;c.</hi> and ſo ran on a long time, with railing, mena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing, dreadful, expreſſions, wher upon I did endeavour to ſtop her, by caſting in ſome words, but it would not be,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:30607:29"/>
ſhe ſtill continued to heap up, and threaten plagues and judgements againſt us; then I went near, thinking to ſpeak a word to her, but ſhe let flee at me with a multitude of rayling, reviling terms, ſuch as they uſe to give to the Miniſters of the Nation, and that in ſuch a fierce and fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious manner, as hardly any Scould in the ſtreet could par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel; whereupon I ſpake theſe words, or to this effect, <hi>That it were fitter ſuch an idle Huſwife as ſhe was, ſhould be whipt, and ſent to Bridwel to work, than to go about railing at people as ſhe did.</hi> And when I had ſpoken theſe words, I went from her, and ſhe went her way, and never was queſtioned, nor puniſhed for any of theſe abuſes; and thoſe words I ſpake but once to her, and this was all I did and the occaſion of it, upon which you build your great ſtructure, concluding that I am no Miniſter of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, but a Perſecutor of the truth, &amp;c. as in your large Letter to me thereupon you declared; and that now in the title page of your Pamphlet you proclaim to the Nation, &amp;c. but I wiſh you lay a better foundation for your other buildings, leſt you prove a fooliſh builder.</p>
            <p>Now I would ask you a few ſober Queſtions.</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>How comes it to paſs, that you can ſtile</hi> Sarah Latchet <hi>a Servant of Jeſus, and publiſh her ſo to the world, who is an Apoſtate, and an Excommunicate perſon, going on in ſuch a rayling, reviling, fierce, manner, as hath been now declared, and as divers witneſſes can prove, whereas there are many pretious Servants of Jeſus, and Saints of the moſt High, now living in</hi> England <hi>and</hi> Briſtol, <hi>that have been known to walk with God for many years in uprightneſs, their foot having held its ſteps, and not declined from the good wayes of the Lord, neither gone back from the Commandments of his lips, but have eſteemed his words, before their appointed food, and have ſtood faſt in the worſt of Times, and ſoreſt of Tryals, &amp;c. and yet they muſt be cenſured, judged, condemned, and cryed out againſt by you, as if they were the vileſt Perſons on earth, and all becauſe they cannot cloſe in with you, and your way? &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="49" facs="tcp:30607:29"/>
Secondly. <hi>How durſt you in your Conſcience ſay, That thoſe raylings, revilings, curſings, and lies, &amp;c. which ſhe uttered, are a teſtifying from the Lord? Do you not bluſh to name, or write ſuch a word? Will</hi> Jehovah, <hi>the great and glorious God of Heaven and Earth, ever own ſuch raylings, revilings, &amp;c. to be a teſtifying from him? Or will he ever juſtifie you, in what you have here written, and publiſhed to the world?</hi> O be aſhamed, and confounded, poor deceived man.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>How will you bring both ends of your Parallel to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether: you endeavour in your Letter to parallel</hi> Sarah Latchet <hi>with</hi> Paul, <hi>and</hi> Sarah Latchet<hi>'s ſufferings with</hi> Paul<hi>'s ſufferings, and me with</hi> Paul<hi>'s Perſecutors?</hi> Now then let me a little examine your Parallel.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Paul</hi> the Apoſtle of Jeſus Chriſt, having received a Commiſſion from heaven, doth accordingly preach and publiſh the glorious Goſpel of the grace, mercy, and love of God in Chriſt to poor ſinners; and likewiſe ſets forth the Lord Jeſus, in his perſon, virtues, and offices, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viting and beſeeching, with all love and tenderneſs, thoſe where ever he came to receive this grace, and believe on the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, &amp;c. And <hi>Sarah Latchet</hi> comes forth rayling, reviling, curſing, &amp;c. <hi>Ergo: Sarah Latchet</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> are alike.</p>
            <p n="2">2. After <hi>Paul</hi> had with meekneſs and love, tendred the grace of God, and the perſon, and vertues of Jeſus Chriſt, the Saviour, as before, ſome did riſe up againſt him, beat him, ſtone him, impriſon him, and whip him, ſo that five times he received forty ſtrips ſave one, with many other fore and cruel abuſes, as you mention in your Letter out of 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And <hi>Sarah Latchet,</hi> after ſhe had rayled, reviled, and pronounced curſes againſt people; it was ſaid to her, <hi>It were fitter ſuch an idle Huſwife were ſent to Bridwel;</hi> Ergo, <hi>Sarah Latchets</hi> ſufferings, and <hi>Pauls</hi> ſufferings, are both a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Pauls</hi> Perſecutors, after they had heard the pretions glad-tydings of the Goſpel, and the report of Jeſus Chriſt
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:30607:30"/>
made unto them, as before, did actually take, and cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beat, ſtone, whip, and impriſon <hi>Paul,</hi> &amp;c. And I af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter I had been reviſed, rayled upon, &amp;c. ſaid of <hi>Sarah Latchet, it were fitter ſhe were whipt and ſent to Bridwel,</hi> Ergo, <hi>Pauls</hi> Perſecutors, and I, were both alike, and under the ſame condemnation, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Is this good Logick? May not all that read your lines, read your folly? &amp;c. But to go on.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Will you ask your Conſcience this queſtion, <hi>Did you not publiſh and ſet forth this thing (to wit, of my not being a Miniſter of the Goſpel, &amp;c.) to lay me, if you could under contempt and ſcorn, both in the City and Nation, though you know in what ſence, and upon what ground, I had denyed the title and dignity of a Miniſter, as I have before declared: but you knowing that this was a nail that would go, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you ſtrick here; and was not this ſuch another piece of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vie and hypocriſie, as poor Mris.</hi> Prince <hi>did manifeſt when ſhe came to rayl at me, and reproach me at my Lecture at</hi> Nicholas, <hi>when in her Conſcience ſhe durſt not object againſt any thing that was delivered, though it were often put to her by me, but inſtead thereof, after much bitter revilings againſt me, called to the People, and bid them to beware of me, for ſhe had heard me ſay,</hi> I had not the Spirit of God, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Now ſuppoſe this had been true, That I had at any time uttered my complaint to her, or any others, in the ſadneſs and bitterneſs of my ſoul, when under temptation (as the Lord knows what ſad hours and dark dayes I have paſſed through, ſince I came to <hi>Briſtol)</hi> though you and many others little obſerved it, or enquired after it: but ſuppoſe, I ſay, I had uttered my complaint to her, as ſhe and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny others have done to me, was it a Chriſtian-like part in her, to publiſh this in the face of a Congregation, many of which might be apt enough to take up a prejudice a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt me? &amp;c. would you, or ſhe, or any other, think it, either honeſty, chriſtianity, ingenuity, civility, or humanity in me, if I ſhould publiſh to the world, what you, or ſhe, or they have at any time uttred to me, as a matter of grief, burden, trouble, ſadneſs, affliction, or temptation, that
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:30607:30"/>
lay upon your, or their ſpirits? now both you and ſhe alſo knew full well the ſad complaints of my ſoul under the ſenſe of my own weakneſs, the fore and terrible temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that I encountred with the greatneſs and weightineſs of my work, the many eyes that were upon me, and the great diſhonour that would have come to the name of Chriſt, if I ſhould have miſcarried in my work, which made me to ſee the neceſſity, and prize the excellency and long for the ſupplies of the Spirit of Chriſt, and often to complain of that ſmall meaſure I apprehend I had of it, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>But Secondly, Both you and ſhe, and ſome others, know in your Conſciences that there was another ground upon which, and another ſenſe in which, I had ſometimes queſtioned, whether I and many other Chriſtians, had yet received the Spirit<hi>:</hi> which for the Readers information, end my own vindication, I ſhall now declare: When I li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in <hi>London,</hi> and ſate under the Miniſtry of ſome choice godly men, I did ſometimes hear expreſſions to this effect, That there was a two-fold coming of the Spirit of Chriſt into the hearts of Believers. The firſt was that by which the eyes of mens underſtandings are opened, and they tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned from darkneſs to light, Faith and Repentance, wrought in the Soul, converſion, regeneration, or the new birth, effected; and ſo he that was once a dead ſinner, becomes a living Saint or Believer, though as yet but weak, a babe in Chriſt, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The Second work or coming of the Spirit, is that by which the Soul is ſealed, confirmed, eſtabliſhed, filled with joy and peace in believing, and fitted and furniſhed to every good work, that God calls them, whether doing or ſuffering, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Now this put me upon the ſearch of the Scripture, as firſt, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1. 13. <hi>After you believed, you were ſealed:</hi> which Scripture relates to that <hi>Acts</hi> 19. 2. <hi>Have you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the holy Spirit ſince you believed? &amp;c.</hi> So <hi>Acts</hi> 8. 14. to 17. <hi>Samaria</hi> having received the Word of God, and believed in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, were baptized by <hi>Philip</hi>
               <pb n="52" facs="tcp:30607:31"/>
the Deacon, the Church at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> or rather the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles ſent forth <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> that they ſhould pray, that they might receive the holy Ghoſt, for as yet he was not fallen upon any of them, &amp;c. Another Scripture, I find, <hi>Joh.</hi> 7. 37, 38, 39. <hi>In the laſt day the great day of the feaſt Jeſus ſtood and cryed, ſaying, If any man thirſt, let him come unto me and drink, he that believeth on me as the Scripture hath ſaid, out of his belly ſhall flow rivers of living water: but this ſpake he of the Spirit, which they that believe on him ſhould receive, for the holy Ghoſt was not yet (given) becauſe that Jeſus was not yet glorified:</hi> So <hi>Luke</hi> 11. 9. to 13. ſuch as God is a Father unto, are bid to pray, to ask, to ſeek, and to knock, &amp;c. with aſſurance, by many Arguments, <hi>that they ſhould receive the holy Spirit:</hi> So in the 14, 15, 16, Chapters of <hi>John,</hi> our Saviour ſpeaking to ſuch as did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in him, love him, and keep his Commandments, &amp;c. he promiſeth to <hi>ſend the Comforter unto them, even the holy Spirit which the world could not receive, &amp;c:</hi> and to this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree many of the Prophecies both in <hi>Iſa. Jer. Ezek. Joel, Zach.</hi> and others.</p>
            <p>Now then as to the firſt work or coming of the Spirit, (namely) to make a man to become a Saint, a Chriſtian, a Believer, a new Creature, &amp;c. I never denied, but alwayes affirmed, that whoſoever did believe in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, or had the leaſt beginning of a work of Grace in their Souls, it was by the Spirit of God, and they had the Spirit of Chriſt in the firſt ſenſe, according to. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 9. <hi>now if any man have not the Spirit of Chriſt, he is none of his, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But in the ſecond or latter ſenſe, namely, <hi>to ſeal, ſtabliſh, fill with joy and comfort, &amp;c.</hi> with many other glorious ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects which the Scripture ſpeaks of, and which the Saints in the primative times, did enjoy, in this ſenſe I have often ſaid, that I did queſtion, Whether I (then) had or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther many others in the Church had received the Spirit? and to this you did then aſſent, &amp;c. And therefore I did often preſs it in the Church, that we might pray more for that bleſſed Spirit, according to the command and promiſe
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:30607:31"/>
of Chriſt, <hi>Luke</hi> 11. 9. 13. as before; and this is that which I have often called the great legacie of the new Teſtament, and as Jeſus Chriſt was the great promiſe of the firſt or old Teſtament, ſo this bleſſed Spirit is the great promiſe of the ſecond or new Teſtament, which all believers are to wait, pray, and long for, as the believers under the firſt Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, were to wait and long for the <hi>Meſſiah;</hi> and this was my meaning, when I have ſometimes ſaid, That a man may be a Chriſtian, a Believer, a converted Soul, or a babe in Chriſt, and not as yet have received the Spirit, I mean ſtill in this latter ſenſe, in reſpect of ſealing, eſtabliſhing, &amp;c. yet I neither did, nor do expect the Gift of tongues, or working Miracles, &amp;c. neither do I find that the great promiſe of the Spirit, was principally to that end, though that was accompliſhed by it, when and how the Lord plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, as <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 4. with divers miracles and gifts, or diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butions of the holy Ghoſt, according to his own will, but I find rather that the great promiſe of the Spirit, is, for ſuch glorious ends as theſe, &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="1">1. To open and reveal the hidden Myſteries of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of heaven, as <hi>Matth.</hi> 13. 11. <hi>to you it is given to know the Myſteries of the kingdom of Heaven, &amp;c.</hi> So 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 9. to the 14. we read that thoſe things which the eyes of men (as men) have not ſeen, neither can the natural man per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, yet God doth reveal by his Spirit, &amp;c. So it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed in <hi>John,</hi> to lead and guide into all truth, therefore, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 17. the Apoſtle prayes for believers, that they might receive the Spirit of wiſdom and revelation, &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="2">2. To comfort and chear up poor drooping believers, filling them with all joy and peace, conſolation and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhment, which is one main end for which it is promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed: as in 14, 15, 16, Chapters of <hi>John,</hi> to which agree many of the ſayings of the Prophets, &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="3">3. To heighten and ſtrengthen the Saints with bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, courage, conſtancy, and reſolution in their Spirits, to do, or to ſuffer for God, as <hi>Acts</hi> 4 8. <hi>Then</hi> Peter <hi>filled with the Holy Ghoſt, ſaid, &amp;c.</hi> ſo to the 19. <hi>verſ.</hi> So <hi>Acts</hi> 5. 41. <hi>And they—rejoyced that they were counted worthy to</hi>
               <pb n="54" facs="tcp:30607:32"/>
               <hi>ſuffer, &amp;c.</hi> which thing neither they nor <hi>Peter</hi> could do (a little before, as <hi>Mark</hi> 14. 50<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 66 to 71.) But obſerve, <hi>they had not then received the Spirit,</hi> ſo <hi>Acts</hi> 16. 25. <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> ſang in priſon</p>
            <p n="4">4. To purge and purifie, clenſe and ſanctifie believers, and make them holy, as <hi>Iſa.</hi> 4. 3, 4. ſo <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36. 25. to 29. <hi>Joel.</hi> 3. 17. then ſhall <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> be holy, that is, when the Mountains ſhall drop new wine, and the hills flow with milk; as <hi>verſ.</hi> 18. <hi>And the fountain come forth of the houſe of the Lord, to water the valley of</hi> Shittim.</p>
            <p n="5">5. To make poor, dry, barren, empty ſouls to become fruitful to God, and to grow in grace, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 32. 5. <hi>until the Spirit be poured from on high, and the wilderneſs become a fruitful field,</hi> Iſa. 44. 3, 4. <hi>I will pour my Spirt upon thy ſeed, &amp;c. and they ſhall ſpring up, &amp;c.</hi> ſo <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 14. 5. <hi>I will be as the dew unto</hi> Iſrael, <hi>and he ſhall grow, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6. To fill the Saints with meekneſs and love, yea, with end cared love towards Chriſt, and bowels of pity towards men, as we ſee it was with the Saints in the primitive times, but is much wanting now</p>
            <p n="7">7. To unite the Saints more together in judgement and affection into one heart, and one way, as the Scripture ſpeaks.</p>
            <p n="8">8. To make them more exact and ſpiritual in the uſe and practiſe of all Goſpel Ordinances, as <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 41. to 47.</p>

            <p n="10">10. To fill them with a mighty Spirit of Faith and Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, as the Saints in the primitive times, after the pouring forth of the Spirit had.</p>
            <p>In a word it is a Chriſtians <hi>All,</hi> for by it he can do all things, as <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 19. 4. 13. and without it he can do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing well, as <hi>John</hi> 15. 5. <hi>Without me ye can do nothing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And thus I have declared my judgment fully about this bleſſed truth, and what I mean by the pouring forth of the glorious Spirit which I ſo often mention in prayer and preaching, as the great legacy, privilege, and portion of
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:30607:32"/>
the Saints or believers in the New Teſtament, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Now then let me ask you this Queſtion, Whether it had not been better for you, and thoſe that are gone away with you, that you had ſet your ſelves ſolemnly to ſeek the Lord by Supplication and Prayer, and ſo have continued in the wayes, and under the Ordinances of Chriſt, waiting for that bleſſed ſpirit, as many of the Servants of God have done, and ſtill do, &amp;c. rather than to have taken up a No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>a Light in every man,</hi> and call that <hi>the eternal Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi> as ſome of your way do, and then jeer and ſcoff at them, that pray for the Spirit, and reproach them which complain out of their ſenſe of the want of it, as poor Mris. <hi>Prince</hi> did, when ſhe came to revile me at my Lecture, &amp;c. But bleſſed be the Lord, there are many Churches in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Wales,</hi> that are now wreſtling with the Lord day after day joyntly, and day and night ſingly (in the deep ſenſe of their wants) for the accompliſhment of that glorious, new-Teſtament promiſe, and ſuch an Anſwer is already given to ſome, both Independant and Baptized, as you call them, that they have no cauſe to repent of the time they have ſet apart for that work; and I verily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, That if the people whom you and others ſo much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe, go on and continue praying as now they do, for the pouring forth of the bleſſed Spirit, there will ſhortly be ſuch a breaking forth of the day of Chriſt, that all the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſtian foggs, of falſe doctrins and falſe worſhips, will flie and fall, as the darkneſs before the riſing Sun.</p>
            <p>And Oh that ſome men in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Briſtol</hi> that are now wrangling and quarrelling about their humane learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and ſcoffing and envying thoſe that have it not, would ſeriouſly conſider this thing, before their lamp go out in obſcurity, and their feet ſtumble upon the dark mountains, before their arm be dried up, and their eye utterly dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Now before I part with this, I will alſo clear my ſelf a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout another expreſſion, that I have ſometimes uſed, and at which many have been offended, and that is about an old and a new Teſtament Spirit (though of late to avoid
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:30607:33"/>
offence, have forbore it) now by thoſe expreſſions, I did not mean nor intend the Spirit of God, ſo as to call that an old Teſtament Spirit, for I know that Spirit, was one and the ſame from everlaſting, but by an old or new-Teſtament Spirit.</p>
            <p n="1">1. I mean the frame and temper of a mans own Spirit, and ſo by an old-Teſtament Spirit, I alwayes mean, that dark, weak, childiſh and low frame and temper of Spirit, which profeſſors generally had, in the time of the old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, while under the <hi>Moſaical</hi> adminiſtration, with that bondage and fear, that weakneſs and ſadneſs, that did accompany it, &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="2">2. By a new-Teſtament Spirit, I alwayes mean, that lively, chearful, active, joyful, bold, ſon-like frame and temper of Spirit, which the Saints generally in the primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive times under the new Teſtament did enjoy, which is called a Spirit of Adoption, as the other is called a Spirit of Bondage; a full deſcription of what I mean is ſet forth in two Scriptures, as namely, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. from the 1. to the 7. and <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. from 18 to 24. In which two Scriptures is ſet forth,</p>
            <p>Firſt, The weakneſs, darkneſs, childiſhneſs, fear, bondage, &amp;c. of the old-Teſtament ſtate, which is that that I call, the frame, temper, or ſpirit of the old-Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>And Secondly, There is ſet forth, the light, life, ſtrength, boldneſs, comfort, courage, joy, &amp; rejoycing of the new-Teſtament ſtate, which is that that I call, the frame, temper, or Spirit of the new Teſtament, &amp;c. And whether Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians be not generally, more under the old-Teſtament frame, than under the new, I leave to their experiences<hi>:</hi> and thus I have fully declared my ſelf, as to theſe two parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars; and if any ſober Chriſtian, into whoſe hands this may come, ſhall apprehend that I am miſtaken in either of them, I ſhall be glad to receive a word from them in love, but I do not expect it from you, to whom I now write, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>You farther tell me in your Letter, that you were
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:30607:33"/>
warned from inviſible lights ſome months paſt, to beware of me, which you could not believe, till now it breaks out like fire, &amp;c. I conceive thoſe inviſible lights, were ſome ſecret whiſperers that did bring you many ſtories, both of me, and others, &amp;c. but truly I could diſcern by viſible light, long before you left us, that my ſpeaking was but little acceptable to you, and ſome others, eſpecially after I did begin to oppoſe your ſpleen and paſſion, though whilſt I ſate ſtill and ſilently approved of what you ſpake, then I was the excellenteſt man that ever you met with, &amp; you would often, both to my face, and behind my back, applaud and extol me; but when once I began a little to croſs you, as many others of the Brethren did, and as ſome godly men had formerly done (as they ſaw cauſe enough) then you and your partie began to fume and fret, and as it was often obſerved to go out of the Meetings, when I had been to ſpeak though I did oppoſe you with all the tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that poſſibly I could, as knowing what a partie you had in the Church, and what influence you had upon them; but now you ſay the fruits doth appear, and break out like fire, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>And what is it?]</hi> But that I ſhould ſay, That ſuch an idle Huſwife, as is before mentioned, ſhould be ſent to <hi>Bridwel,</hi> rather than to go rayling about, as ſhe did: Now I appeal to all Chriſtians upon the face of the earth, what hurt this was, to this poor, rayling, curſing, fierce crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture? &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> And was this the ground upon which ſome of your company ſpread it about the Country, and place of my na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity, what a perſecutor I was become, ſo that the good people there, that had known me to be of another temper, did wonder, and were troubled, until they underſtood, what you and your company meant by ſuch things, and that it was becauſe I would not joyn with you and your new Religion, and with the people that call themſelves <hi>Quakers.</hi> Again, Was this the ground upon which you did ſo often cry out againſt <hi>Judaſes</hi> in the Church, a little before you left us; but bleſſed be the Lord, we can now
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:30607:34"/>
rejoice, that the innocencie of the upright is cleared, and the <hi>Judaſes</hi> are diſcovered, &amp;c. and whether I or you have betraied and crucified the Lord Jeſus, in his Saints, in his waies, in his name, and in his truth, I ſhall humbly leave, &amp;c. I do not boaſt, but deſire with all humilitie and reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to acknowledge and admire the power, grace, mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and goodneſs of him by whom, I a poor worm have been preſerved, whilſt ſuch a Cedar, or Star, as you were taken to be, is ſo ſadlie fallen; but it is no more than what ſome have thought and ſaid long ago, That pride and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogancie would have a fall, as <hi>Prov.</hi> 29. 23. <hi>But let him that thinketh he ſtands, take heed leſt he fall, &amp;c.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 12.</p>
            <p>But now you ſay, I openly oppoſe the appearance of Chriſt, where it is found in life and power, &amp;c. What, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I ſaid of that poor deluded Creature, <hi>It were fitter ſhe were ſent to Bridwel?</hi> O poor deceived man, that you ſhould be a profeſſor of Religion, ſo long, and now come to publiſh ſuch a piece of folly to the world, as to call the <note place="margin">Since this I have been three times diſturbed for which one is now impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned.</note> fierce raylings, &amp;c. of theſe people, <hi>the appearances of Chriſt, in life and power;</hi> and my ſpeaking that one word to her once, <hi>an oppoſing of Chriſt, &amp;c.</hi> whereas ſhe had no hurt done her, not a word ſpoken to any Magiſtrate a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt her; nay, though ſhe, and others of your way, have 16 or 17 times oppoſed me, and rayled at me, yet never but one, and that but once was queſtioned or impriſoned for it, and yet I am cried out againſt in word and writing by you and your companie, as the great perſecutor, which now you tell the world you have been warned by inviſible lights ſome months paſt, to beware of me: But how can you call <hi>Sarah Latchet</hi> the <hi>Servants</hi> of God, and <hi>Witneſſes</hi> of Jeſus (in the plural number) whereas it was but to ſhe only, and that but once I ſpake thoſe words, though ſhe rayled at me many times, but ask your own heart, whether your Deſign were not to draw out my ſuppoſed Offence to the world, and then conſider, whether inſtead thereof you have not let out your own folly, envie, and hypocriſi? But where is that meekneſs, and bearing, that ſome of you
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:30607:34"/>
boaſt of, <hi>that you would not return evil for evil, but being curſed, you bleſs, &amp;c.</hi> poor-creatures, it is an eaſie thing to flatter your ſelves, and ſpeak words, &amp;c. but let any one touch you, though but in a word, and they ſhall find you as rough, both in rayling and writing, as any: But what would you have done unto me, if I ſhould have come into your Meetings and diſturbed you, and railed at you, &amp;c. as ſhe and others have done at me? you would have ſent me (not to <hi>Bridwel)</hi> but to the bottomleſs pit, if words could have done it? You cloſe your Letter with many ſeeming expreſſions of love and pity<hi>:</hi> as,
<list>
                  <item>1. That I might ſee the ſandineſs of my foundation.</item>

            </p>
            <p n="1">1. As for my foundation, I know no other, nor preach no other than that foundation and Corner ſtone which is laid in <hi>Sion,</hi> even Jeſus Chriſt, the Son of God, and Son of man, in one perſon, upon whom, through grace, I have caſt my ſoul for eternity, and other foundations I look not for, &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>As to my knowing the things that belong to my peace, &amp;c.</hi> I bleſs the Lord it is the groaning of my ſoul to him, for that bleſſed Spirit of revelation, in the knowledge of the Myſterie of God, and of the Father, and of Chriſt, that I may believe more, love more, and obey more, &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>As for my eſcaping the Pit:</hi> I deſire the like for you<hi>:</hi> and in order to that, I have conſented to, and helped on, the Admonitions that have been ſent by the Church to you, and the other poor ſouls that are with you, &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="4">4.

by Jeſus Chriſt the true door or way, and by the ſtrait gate of believing, which the Scribes and Phariſees, by putting men upon working for life, did ſhut up againſt themſelves, and others: and who doth ſo now, but thoſe that bid all men <hi>turn to a Light within them,</hi> and ſo take them off from believing on the perſon of Jeſus Chriſt, or looking to be ſaved by what he hath done, and ſuffered, wrought, and accompliſhed for man, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>But I ſuppoſe your meaning is, That I ſhould give o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver preaching, and come to you, and your way; I know this hath been the longing deſire of many of you a great while: for theſe were the words of one of your way, the laſt time I was in your houſe, <hi>That I kept many from receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or embracing the Light:</hi> but I deſire to bleſs the Lord, that through the riches of his grace to my ſoul, I have been hitherto preſerved, and I have ſeen my Call to, and Work in this City clearer ſince you left us, than ever I did before, both as to this poor deſolate Church, and likewiſe to many precious ſouls in <hi>Briſtol,</hi> among both of which I truſt I may ſay with humility and comfort, that God hath made me of ſome uſe, though I be as nothing, &amp;c. And truly I do hope, that God who chuſeth the things that are not, to confound the things that are, &amp;c. wil yet uſe me, as an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument for good unto his people in this City, and the rather becauſe, both you with them of your way, and others that are of other waies, do ſo violently, and cauſeleſly ſet againſt me, which makes me ſometimes take up the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint of the Prophet <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> Jer. 15. 10. <hi>Wo is me, &amp;c.

And thus I have done with the ſubſtance of your Letter, I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to add a ſhort word to the enſuing part of your Book, but I ſhall firſt make a little digreſſion, by joyning an occaſional word to what I have now written, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>I ſhall deſire you to Conſider, Whether you are not
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:30607:35"/>
by this act of yours, in publiſhing me thus to the world, tickled the hearts, and pleaſed the fancies of many, who were full enough of prejudice againſt me before; nay, are you not joyned as a Brother in bitterneſs, with him that wrote the late Book, called, <hi>Satan Enthroned in his chair of Peſtilence:</hi> Let any judicious Chriſtian compare your Book with the latter part of his, and ſee whether thoſe two bitter ſtreams, do not both ariſe from one corrupt foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain; namely, the Spirit that is from beneath: may not I return your own words upon you, which you unjuſtly charge upon me and this Church, from <hi>Obediah</hi> 11, <hi>Thou waſt like one of them, &amp;c.</hi> and is this the kindneſs of a friend, or the part of a brother? O how truly are thoſe Scriptures fulfilled in you, <hi>Mic.</hi> 7. 5. <hi>Truſt ye not in a friend &amp;c.</hi> Jer. 9. 4. <hi>Take ye heed, &amp;c.</hi> for every brother will utterly ſupplant, and every neighbour will walk with ſlanders. You had written your Letter to me about a year ago; and if you had known ought by me, you might have written more; but for you, now to publiſh it to the world, and to proclaim it in your Frontiſpiece, and that in ſuch a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile manner, that he that reads your title page and my name, would verily think (if they did not know other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe) that I were ſome dreadful perſecutor, and that I had cauſed ſome Servant of Chriſt to be whipt and puniſhed: but I truſt the Lord will look upon my wrong; and your envie; my innocency, and your hypocriſies, &amp;c. but I know it is in vain to write farther to you, and truly had it not been for the vindication of the truth, and ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fact on of ſome poor ſouls in this City and Nation, I ſhould have caſt your Book, and the other mans Book aſide, and never have troubled my ſelf to have anſwered you or him; but ſince it is ſo, that both your Books are ſpread abroad, and read by many, at which ſome are grieved; others ſtag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gered, and people generally apt to conclude that things are ſo, as he and you have ſaid, becauſe I am ſilent and ſay nothing, as I remember it was with me once before, when a publick Scandal was raiſed and caſt upon me at my firſt coming to <hi>Briſtol,</hi> which the Lord knew, and I in my
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:30607:36"/>
own Conſcience knew, I was as innocent in, as any man or child under heaven, and therefore ſate ſtill about half a year, reſolving my innocency ſhould anſwer for me, &amp;c. which made many conclude I was guilty becauſe I was ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, till at length I was forced to ſeek a publick Vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by the Magiſtrate (which I had) and then the mouths of bad people were ſtopped, and the minds of good peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſatisfied<hi>:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So I conceive it might be now, if I were wholly ſilent, as to what you and he do write, though indeed I had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved ſilence, and to have given you, and him, and others, leave to have trampled upon me; and were I in a private capacity, I think I ſhould do ſo<hi>:</hi> but foraſmuch as the Lord hath ſet me as a publick inſtrument in his work, and that; that which you and he have written of me, tends much to the defaming of me, and the hindrance of my work, by laying ſtumbling blocks of prejudice, into the minds of people againſt me, I therefore think my ſelf bound for the truths ſake; and for the ſake of ſome good people in this City; being thereunto alſo adviſed and perſwaded by godly friends, to ſet forth a few words of truth and ſober<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, both to your Book and his.</p>
            <p>And I deſire that neither you nor he will be offended that I joyn you both together in this my Anſwer, for firſt you are much alike Brethren in bitterneſs, againſt the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple called Independants and Baptized, as may be ſeen throughout your Book<hi>:</hi> and in the latter part of his.</p>
            <p>Secondly, I find, that he hath often joyned you with me, therefore I think it not improper to coupple him with you, and I hope that neither your friends, nor his, will look upon my ſo doing as any diſparagment to you, or him. Yet I muſt needs ſay in ſome things he is more modeſt than you in that he doth not name me, as you often do, though in ſome things you are more ſerious than he, in that you do not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> as he often doth; but both you and he have done what you could, to lay me under contempt and ſcorn to the whole City and Nation, and therefore I ſhall now addreſs my ſelf to anſwer ſome few paſſages in his
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:30607:36"/>
Book, though not for your information, but for my own Vindication, and for publick and general ſatisfaction, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>And firſt in the 48 page of that his Book, called, <hi>Satan enthroned in his Chair of Peſtilence, &amp;c.</hi> he tells a ſtory, how they, meaning the Church in <hi>Briſtol,</hi> ſend for a Taylor out of <hi>Wales</hi> to be their Teacher, &amp;c. in which he deals very diſ-ingeniouſly, for firſt, he knew that I was ſent for by the Major of the City, ſome Aldermen, many of the Council, and other Gentlemen and Commiſſioners of the City of <hi>Briſtol,</hi> which I take to be the Repreſentative of the City, &amp;c. As likewiſe, I was ſent for by many of the godly inhabitants, as I have elſewhere declared; and that not only to be a Teacher in the Church of <hi>Briſtol,</hi> but to be a publick Preacher of the Goſpel in the City, as I have, through the help and grace of Chriſt, hitherto continued; and he himſelf, at my firſt coming, gave me the right hand of fellowſhip, and profeſſed he was ſatisfied in my Call.</p>
            <p>But ſecondly, I was no more a Taylor in <hi>Wales,</hi> than he was any of his former Callings after he came to <hi>Briſtol:</hi> For when I was called to Preach the Goſpel in <hi>Wales,</hi> I left my former Employment, as he did leave his ſeveral Callings, when he took to Preaching: the next thing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning me in his Book, is page 50. where he mentioneth a great Woman, that had three Children unbaptized<hi>:</hi> the truth of which I ſhall relate, by which the falſeneſs of his Relation will appear, &amp;c. There was about the time of my coming firſt to <hi>Briſtol</hi> a godly woman, one at whoſe Husbands houſe, the Church did often uſe to meet; ſhe having been delivered of a Child, did about a month after deſire the Church to meet at her houſe, to render praiſe to the Lord, and to ſpend ſome time in Prayer and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, &amp;c. accordingly the Elder, that then was, did upon the firſt day of the week appoint that the next Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſhould be at ſuch a place, to ſuch an end: now when the Church was met, ſhe deſired that her Children might alſo be preſented to the Lord by Prayer, both that which ſhe then lay in with, and one more about the age of two
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:30607:37"/>
years, whether any more of her Children were then pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, I do not remember; but the like was done again a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout two years after, when the Lord gave her another Child, and as it hath been done for many others upon the like occaſion, and as I have known it often done in <hi>Wales,</hi> and I here recommend it to all ſober Chriſtians, eſpecially ſuch as are diſſatisfied in their judgments and Conſciences, about Infants Baptiſm, namely, That when any godly Woman, a Member of a Congregation, hath received ſuch a mercy, ſhe ſhould at ſome convenient ſeaſon preſent her ſelf with her Child in the Church, that Praiſe may be rendred to the Lord on her behalf, preſenting her Child alſo to the Lord by Prayer, &amp;c. at which time the Parents may declare in the Congregation the name of the Child, that it may be entered into the Book, where the names of the Congregation are written, as the Children of the Church, who upon occaſion may be mentioned to the Lord as the ſeed of the faithful, that when theſe Children come to age, and the Lord ſhall give them to profeſs Faith in Chriſt, and that they do believe with all their hearts, as <hi>Acts</hi> 8. 37. they may then be admitted to the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of Chriſt, both Baptiſm, and the Lords Supper, as Believers were in the Primitive times, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 41, 42. this I leave to the Conſideration of all, but eſpecially ſuch as do not ſee ground to ſprinckle their Children, and I the rather mention this, becauſe there are many who ſince they left of Infant Baptiſm, that are (as I conceive) too remiſs in the duty of thankfulneſs, and too careleſs of the preti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Souls of their Children, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Now this was all, that I know, that was in the eye and intent of this godly Woman, and this was the utmoſt which was done at that time, concerning the Woman and her two children, (which this man calls a blood-daring at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt) which I deſire the judicious Reader to conſider, &amp;c. As for this jerking, jeering, quibling, and ſcoffing at the learned Teacher, the reverent Congregation, the mock-Ordinance, and dry Baptiſm, &amp;c. I ſhall not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer him, leſt I ſhould be like unto him, neither can I ſay
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:30607:37"/>
what diſcourſe ſhe had with the other diſcreet Gentlewo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man which he mentioneth, but this I know, the Woman was a very judicious Chriſtian, and was well informed and ſatisfied about the unwartantableneſs of Infant-Baptiſm, and was her ſelf ſhortly after Baptized, according to the true intent, manner and adminiſtration of that Ordinance, ſo that this was no invention to give her ſatisfaction, as he ſaith; neither did ſhe or any of the Congregation look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this as Bapt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>m, for both ſhe and they (for ought I know) were fully ſatisfied againſt that practice, before I had ever any acquaintance with her or them; and for his jerking, and jeering again about prayer, before and after and about the words of Inſtitution to the new Ordinance, &amp;c. All which might better become the mouth of a Stage-player, than the pen of a Miniſter. And for his ſaying the Children were as much heathen as before; truly I truſt they had more benefit by this ſolemn act of the Churches prayer, than if he had in his way baptized them; but I did not think till now, that he had held that Children were made Chriſtians by Baptiſm.</p>
            <p>The next thing he mentions is, about my being Bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed at <hi>London,</hi> &amp;c. I had two reaſons for my being Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized there rather than here: Firſt, becauſe I am a Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of a Church there, who are of the ſame judgement, as to this particular: Secondly, becauſe I knew none there that had that latitude in their Principles, as to Baptize me, unleſs I ſhould come off from this Church in point of Communion, which in my conſcience I could not do, I knowing them to be a pretious godly people, how ever now under contempt; but that I did it there, or that I concealed it at all to ſave my Maintenance, that is not true; for I did publickly own it as ſoon as I did come home, though with that moderation and tenderneſs, as not to grieve or offend any, but as for his jerking and jeering, at my falling from dry Baptiſm to Dipping, &amp;c. I ſhall not anſwer him: But for that godly man Mr. <hi>Jeſſe,</hi> whom he calls an <hi>Anabaptiſt,</hi> Teacher of <hi>London,</hi> I ſhall not ſay much for him, he hath grace enough to bear his reproches,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:30607:38"/>
onely this I muſt ſay, his coming hither was not to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form any <hi>Biſhop like</hi> confirmation, as this man ſeems to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate; but rather to endeavour the ſetling and eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the minds of the People of this Citie, againſt the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious Doctrin of the <hi>Quakers;</hi> and I believe his endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours were not ſucceſsleſs in that thing. Again, for my becoming an open profeſſed Dipper, (as he ſaith) though I abhor his jeering, yet I do own the word and practice, and therein I do no more than all the Preachers in <hi>Briſtol</hi> do, for they Baptize and Preach, and I Preach and Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize; onely they Baptize Infants, and I Baptize Men and Women, as <hi>Philip</hi> did, <hi>Acts</hi> 8. 12. and whoſe practice is moſt juſtifiable, theirs or mine, I refer to the Scriptures in their proper and genuine ſenſe to determine, and to any judicious impartial Scholar to interpret, as <hi>Iohn</hi> 3. 23. <hi>Acts</hi> 8. 37, 38, 39. <hi>Acts</hi> 10. 47, 48. <hi>Acts</hi> 22. 16. But for my unchriſtening him and his Children; I never uttered ſuch a word; but if my practice grounded upon Scripture do it, J ought not to be blamed: Likewiſe for his unchriſtian-like dealing with that godly man, Mr. <hi>Tombs,</hi> publiſhing his name to the World; I ſhall ſay little, for he hath wiſdom and grace, either to anſwer him, or to bear his reproa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, onely this I perceive by a Letter from Mr. <hi>Tombs,</hi> that the thing is falſe; And for his calling Mr. <hi>Tombs</hi> our greateſt Champion, &amp;c. truly the man is much miſtaken, for we do not lean upon Man for our practice, we ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving both the Command and example of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and his bleſſed Apoſtles, recorded in Scripture, as <hi>Matt.</hi> 28. <hi>Mark</hi> 16. <hi>Luke</hi> 3. 23. Chriſt himſelf was Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized when he was about 30 years of age; ſo that Mr. <hi>Tombs,</hi> is not our Champion: But for his miſ-drawn con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences, how I can give the Lords Supper to the Devils children, if Mr. <hi>Tombs</hi> had ſaid ſo, as he writes of him, would it therefore follow, that I, and all others, muſt be of Mr. <hi>Tombs</hi> his mind in that thing? I cannot ſee this to be a neceſſary conſequence, &amp;c. but I do abhor and deteſt any ſuch uncharitable ſenſoriouſneſs, and I believe Mr. <hi>Tombs</hi> doth ſo alſo, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="59" facs="tcp:30607:38"/>
He asketh further, by what authority I make a ſingle judgement to my ſelf; I ask again, how he durſt to ſay that I make a ſingle judgement to my ſelf, when as there are many Churches, and many men both learned and god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that are of my judgement in this particular, ſo as to hold communion with perſons differing in that point? and ſo I do adminiſter the Lords Supper to this people in <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtol,</hi> as they are a Church of godly ſober Chriſtians, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving in Chriſt, though ſome of them miſ-baptized, yet none of them deny the Ordinance of Chriſt, onely ſome of them have not light to ſee the right Adminiſtration of it, but reckon their Infant Baptiſm ſufficient; yet as further light comes in, they are willing to walk up to it, in the mean time we can bear with them in love, as we deſire them and others, to bear with us in other things.</p>
            <p>As for that miſ-conſtrued paſſage in my Lecture, about dry breaſts, which he applies to Infant Baptiſm, &amp;c. 1, I deny that ever I ſpoke thoſe words in ſuch terms: 2. Much leſs to that ſenſe, but I have often prayed againſt that ſore judgement threatned, <hi>Hoſea</hi> 9. 14. and that I might not have a miſcarrying womb, ſo as not to bring any ſoul to Chriſt by converſion; or dry breaſts, ſo as not to feed or refreſh any poor thirſty ſoul, that comes to wait upon God in his Ordinances, as I fear it is with many Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations in <hi>England;</hi> and this was the ſubſtance and ſenſe of what I ſpake, though as for Infant-Baptiſm, I have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared and do declare my diſlike of it; yet ſo as not to judge or condemn any godly man, that thinks he hath Warrant to do it, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>And whereas he ſaith, That the profeſſed, thorow-pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced <hi>Anabaptiſts,</hi> leave me, and would not joyn with me, and therefore commends them that they are true to their principles, and do not juggle, implying that I am not ſo, but do juggle, &amp;c. Truly I know no thorow <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ac'd, godly man, either <hi>Anabaptiſt,</hi> or others in <hi>Briſtol,</hi> but do ſhew love and reſpect to me in their way, onely in this, they walk according to their light, and ſo do I; but they think I am too large in my Principles, and I think they are too
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:30607:39"/>
ſtrait in theirs; yet we do not differ, but can bear with each other in love, though for my juggling or diſ-ingenuity I paſs not to be judged by him, &amp;c. though I know it would pleaſe him better, if I were of a furious, impetuous, violent ſpirit, ſo as to break all in pieces, and ſet the Citie and this Church in a flame, and thereby make my ſelf to be abhorred of all both good and bad; but, I truſt, as the Lord hath, ſo he will graciouſly give me a more ſober, ſweet ſpirit, to walk tenderly towards all, and to do good to all: And truly I can ſay, through grace, that I do not love any man the more or leſs for his judgments ſake, whether he be Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian, Independent, Baptized, &amp;c. But where ever I ſee the Image of Chriſt appear (which is love and holineſs) there I deſire to love and honor.</p>
            <p>And for his large Parentheſes, from page 52. to page 55. wherin he makes an Apologie for his bitterneſs &amp; paſſion, (as he had need enough to do) and then cloſes with a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal, that if we will but acknowledge his Miniſtery, Churches, and Ordinances, to be according to the Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Chriſt, and ſuch as with whom we will hold com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, then he will write a Retractation, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>I anſwer, let him firſt but prove that they are ſo, and then we will ſoon acknowledge it; but till then, though he be ſo wiſe as to propſe it, we ſhall not be ſo fooliſh as to grant it, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>And as for his Marginall Note upon page 55 about our being thought to own their Miniſtery, becauſe we hear ſome of them. Truly, I think, he had need not ſpeak of that, for few of us do hear him, or intend it, till he be of another tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, yet I do not refuſe to hear any ſober, godly man, though I muſt needs ſay, I have but little comfort in, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement to, the hearing of ſome, who are ſo often ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting their paſſion and bitterneſs, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The next thing concerning me is, <hi>pag.</hi> 55. where he layes an accuſation againſt me, and the Society with whom I walk, that we neglected (for a long time) the Declarations of his (Highneſs) for ſolemn meetings, &amp;c. whereby he endevours if he could, to render me, and this Church, obnoxious in the
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:30607:39"/>
eyes of the Governours of <hi>England;</hi> but, through mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, the chief Magiſtrate, and chief Governours of this Common-wealth, have more wiſdom and grace, than to hearken to ſuch accuſations, eſpecially from men of his temper; but if I were ſo wicked, and void of ingenuity, as to go about to accuſe men for ſuch neglects, I might find matter enough to write and publiſh againſt my neighbours; but I abhor and deteſt ſuch an envious and unworthy ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, &amp;c. But I do not remember that ever this Church neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected one ſuch meeting, neither did I ever omit above once or twice, at the moſt, preaching publickly, as I durſt appeal to the whole Citie to bear me witneſs; but ſuppoſe I had upon the change of the Government, being ſcrupled or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatisfied, ſo as to omit once or twice preaching, are there none in <hi>England</hi> or <hi>Briſtoll</hi> have done the like, and is it the part of a Miniſter to rake up old Stories, to preſent to the ears of the Magiſtrate, and to publiſh to the Nation to incenſe them againſt a perſon or people that live peaceably under, are ſubject unto, and make ſupplication for thoſe that are in authority, as the Scriptures require, <hi>Titus</hi> 3. 1. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 1, 2. and as we are well known to do, &amp;c. I ſhall ſay no more but the Lord rebuke the Spirit of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vie, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>As for many other things in his Book, both concerning me and the Church with whom I walk; as firſt, his jeering at our cutting out Churches according to our fancied pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive patern, and our being mar'd in the ſhaping, &amp;c. wherein he pleaſeth himſelf, and men like himſelf<hi>:</hi> And ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, his groſs miſtake in laying the blame of all the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief the Quakers have done in <hi>Briſtoll,</hi> with many other evils and falſities to the charge of this poor Congregation, ſome of whom bave ſtood as much, and born as full a teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony againſt the principles and practices of thoſe miſerable deluded people, as ever he hath done, and perhaps to better purpoſe, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Now as for his large and unlearned Diſcourſe about an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly learned man, being fitter to preach than a godly man, that wanteth onely human learning, in reſpect of divers
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:30607:40"/>
Tongues; as likewiſe his ſuppoſed inſufficiency of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Chriſt, to furniſh and accompliſh, fit and enable men to that work, &amp;c. I ſhall not undertake to anſwer e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very particular that he aſſerts about this matter, from <hi>pag.</hi> 62. to <hi>pag.</hi> 66. Onely if I might be thought worthy to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form ſuch a man as he is, or any other of his mind, I ſhould adviſe them to take heed of grating upon, jerking againſt, ſlighting or undervaluing of that bleſſed Spirit of the Lord Jeſus, in any of its Offices, operations, effects, or different adminiſtrations, in and among the People or Church of God; I ſay, I ſhould adviſe them to take heed, leſt when God ſets the ſolitary in families, the rebellious dwell in a dry land, and whilſt ſome are like trees planted by the waters, never ceaſing to yeild their fruit, others be like the Heath in the Deſart, that ſhould not ſee when God cometh, but inhabite the parched places in the wilderneſs; <hi>For all the Trees of the field ſhall know, that the Lord can bring down the high Tree, and exalt the low Tree, he can dry up the green Tree, and make the dry Tree to flouriſh;</hi> yea, and by the <hi>pouring forth of the Spirit from on high can make the Wilderneſs become a fruitful Field, and the fruitful Field to be counted for a Forreſt,</hi> as <hi>Ezek.</hi> 17. 24. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 32. 15.</p>
            <p>He layes it upon ſome as a reproach, <hi>page</hi> 62. That we teach by the Spirit, &amp;c. I deſire humbly to acknowledge and attribute it unto the bleſſed Spirit of Chriſt, that I have at any time been, or now am enabled in any meaſure to ſpeak or publiſh any truth of God, either to the conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſinners, or to the edification or conſolation of the Saints and People of God; and truly if this man do not lean and depend upon the help of the Spirit in his work of preaching, I ſhall not much wonder, if his Miniſtry prove as I have ſometimes ſaid or feared, many mens have done, as a miſcarrying Womb, and dry breaſts, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all their great learning, of which they ſeem to boaſt. &amp;. He further demands, <hi>page</hi> 62. whether all that have the Spirit can teach publickly, &amp;c. Firſt, if by teaching publickly, he mean preaching and publiſhing what God hath done for them; and likewiſe declaring to others what
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:30607:40"/>
the Lord hath taught them, &amp;c. Then I anſwer it is the duty of all Chriſtians ſo to do, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. 10. <hi>As every man hath received the gift, ſo let him miniſter the ſame, &amp;c.</hi> as <hi>Eldad</hi> and <hi>Medad</hi> did, <hi>Numb.</hi> 11. though one man envi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>td, and another complained, as ſome do now, yet <hi>Moſes</hi> the man of God, he approved of it, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>But ſecondly, if by preaching publickly, he mean a publick and ſolemn undertaking the work of preaching &amp;c. Then I anſwer, I do not think that every one, that hath the Spirit of Chriſt in him, or the work of grace in his ſoul, is fit to be a publick Preacher; for there are diverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of gifts, and differences of adminiſtrations, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 4. to the 11. Yet, where the Spirit of God hath fitted any, and the People of God that know them well, do ſee them fit, and judge them fit, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove of them publickly, calling them thereunto, theſe may be fit to teach publickly, at leſt to their own Nation, as the 70 Diſciples were, <hi>Luke</hi> 10. 1. though they had no gifts of Tongues as we read of, no more than the twelve Apoſtles had, during the time of their preaching to their own Nation, before the Aſſention of Chriſt; and that they were to preach to all Nations according to their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Commiſſion, <hi>Matt.</hi> 28. <hi>Mark</hi> 16. yet I do not in the leaſt ſlight, deſpiſe, or undervalue learning, nor learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men, that have grace with it, and do not ſcornfully trample upon them that want it; but to ſay that no man may preach without it, is to make a law, where Chriſt hath made none; for the ſeventy Diſciples, and twelve Apoſtles, did preach long before the day of <hi>Pentecoſt,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>He likewiſe demands, who will ſtep forth and tell him, (and not lie) that the Spirit doth teach them to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the meaning of the word Juſtification, or Adoption, &amp;c. I anſwer, if none but ſuch as can ſpeak Greek and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin, can underſtand what Juſtification and Adoption is, &amp;c. how then can any that have not Greek or Latin, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve they are juſtified or adopted, ſeeing that it is another Maxim in the Schools, that no man can believe more than he doth underſtand: But ſurely thoſe Souls that have been firſt enlightened by the Word and Spirit of Chriſt, to ſee
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:30607:41"/>
and know their loſt condition, while under ſenſe of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation; and hath alſo been led by the ſame Spirit through the Word of grace, to believe on the Lord Jeſus Chriſt with all ther hearts, and by his pretious blood, to ſee themſelves freed from condemnation, and in his righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs to be made righteous, aod ſo to find the comfort of it in ſome meaſure in their own ſouls, they can ſpeak of it to the praiſe of God, and to the edification of others, and that by the help and aſſiſtance of the ſame bleſſed Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, yea perhaps more ſenſibly, feelingly, plainly, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitably, than the moſt learned Doctor in the world, that knows it onely ſpeculatively, by learning, reading, and ſtudying.</p>
            <p>As for that ſcornful word <hi>unlettered,</hi> which he doth ſo often uſe, and caſt as a reproach upon ſome men, &amp;c. I anſwer, truly ſome of us do know our Letters as well, and can put them together into Syllables and Sentences as right, and pronounce them as diſtinct and plain, perhaps as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; but I ſhall not ad to this, onely conclude with <hi>Prov.</hi> 3. 34. <hi>Surely the Lord ſcorneth the ſcorner, and giveth grace to the lowly.</hi> And I deſire ſeriouſly to weigh, and to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend to all ſober Chriſtians, thoſe words of the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. from 19. to 29. and <hi>Chap.</hi> 2. from 1. to 15. and <hi>Chap.</hi> 3. 18, 19, 20. by all which it appears, the great A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle of Chriſt, was of another mind, than this man ſeems to be. He demands <hi>page</hi> 65. what an unlettered Teacher, or Ignoramus would ſay, if he were to diſcourſe with a <hi>Papiſt,</hi> or an Adverſary about Juſtification, &amp;c. Truly, I would ſay this, if any ſhould out of pride, curioſity, and vain confidence, run without a call, to diſcourſe with an Adverſary, <hi>(Papiſts</hi> or others) about that or any other point of Chriſtianity, &amp;c. he might expect that the Lord might juſtly leave him to himſelf, and ſo he might betray, or ſhame the truth, and ſo might it be with the moſt learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Teacher in the world.</p>
            <p>But ſecondly, if a godly man were providentially, or clearly called, to maintain or defend, that or any other truth of God againſt an Adverſary, <hi>(Papiſt</hi> or others) he going in the fear of the Lord, and in a ſenſe of ſelf-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficiency,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:30607:41"/>
in faith and hope of the preſence and aſſiſtance of the grace and Spirit of Chriſt, he might expect according to his promiſe, <hi>Matt.</hi> 10. 9. <hi>Take no thought for it ſhall be given you in that ſame hour, what ye ſhall ſpeak.</hi> And verſe 20. <hi>For it is not ye which ſpeak, but the Spirit of your Father which ſpeaketh in you.</hi> And how truly was this fulfilled in the <hi>Martyrs,</hi> both in plain Country-men, and alſo Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, yea, young Youths and Mayds, who diſcourſing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout points of Chriſtian Religion, and diſputing with men of as profound Learning, as ſome are now, who boaſt ſo much of it, namely, the <hi>Popiſh Biſhops</hi> and <hi>Doctors,</hi> and how thoſe poor <hi>Martyrs</hi> did by the help of the bleſſed Spirit, without Latin or Greek, confound thoſe enemies of truth, and aſſert and maintain both the Doctrin of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification, and other points of Chriſtian Religion, as the Hiſtory of Acts and Monuments do ſufficiently declare; and though we have no cauſe to preſume, yet we have good ground to hope and believe, that the ſame God, will by the ſame Spirit, give in the ſame ſupplies to his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants in the ſame caſe, if he ſhould again call them to it, or if he ſhould call any of us to aſſert and maintain the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> Doctrin of Juſtification, or to deſpute the glorious pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilege of Adoption. And whereas he ſaith, <hi>page</hi> 56. That we give out our ſelves to be gifted Brethren, and ſo fit for the work of the Miniſtry, &amp;c. For my own part I do not know that ever I gave out ſuch a word, and the Lord knows, that I have lower and meaner thoughts of my ſelf; and truly had not the importunity and perſwaſions of ſome prevailed with me, beyond what I thought of my ſelf, I think I had never been an eye-ſore to this man in <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtol,</hi> nor a trouble to any others in the work of preaching; and if he or any other can make it appear to me, that it is the will of God, that I ſhould give over my preſent work, I truſt it is not all the Gold and Silver in <hi>Briſtol,</hi> that ſhould hire me to continue in it; but truly (as other things) ſo the violent oppoſition that I meet with from men of divers ſorts, do much confirm that it is the will of God, that I ſhould continue in my work of preaching, &amp;c. And ſo long (though I ſhould meet with greater difficulties than
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:30607:42"/>
over I have yet done) I truſt I ſhall go on with it, expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting the preſence of Chriſt with me; and his bleſſing upon me therein. I do not at all reflect upon thoſe godly men, that he quotes <hi>page</hi> 66, 67. though I cannot but wonder that a man ſhould expreſs ſo much bitterneſs againſt <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſts,</hi> as he doth in his Book, and yet ſeem ſo to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaud a baptized man, that is a perſon of honor, &amp;c. Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe how a man can ſpeak ſo contemptuouſly againſt Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and ſeparated Churches, and yet ſeem ſo to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaud that eminent Dr. <hi>Owen,</hi> who is a man ſo eminently for the Congregational way, that ſome men call <hi>Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency</hi> or <hi>Separation;</hi> which makes me to think, that if all the people in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Briſtol,</hi> which are called <hi>Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendents</hi> or <hi>Anabaptiſts,</hi> were great or in high places, he would love them, or make them believe ſo, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>But thirdly, for that godly man Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> whoſe face I never ſaw, yet do I highly honor &amp; eſteem for ſome of his works, and for what good I hear of him, yet I ſee no ground, why I ſhould ſo underſtand Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> or the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther two, as this man ſeems to force their meaning; for, admit it be true, that an ungodly learned man, may know as much, or more, of the literal and grammatical ſenſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> Scripture, than a gracious man may do, which is all that they affirm; doth it therefore follow, that a godly unlearn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed man, (if it were proper to call any ſo) may not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand and know, publiſh and declare the truth of Chriſt, to their own comfort, and the edification of others, for my own part I cannot ſee this to be an infallible conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, and I am confident that two of thoſe men are o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe minded; and if godly Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> ſhould mean ſo, yet I know, there are many others of like eminency, both for Learning and Godlineſs, that are of another mind in this particular, as I might abundantly ſhew from their works that are extant, as likewiſe that experience God hath given us in this later age, of his owning, bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, and proſpering, ſuch in the preaching of the Goſpel, to the converſion of many ſouls, both in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Wales,</hi> &amp;c. But what I have here written may be ſufficient to diſprove what he doth falſly aſſert, <hi>page</hi> 67. that the
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:30607:42"/>
pretence of preaching by the Spirit is but a pious fraud, to ſet up our ſelves in the hearts and conſciences, and conſequently in the purſes of people, &amp;c which thing he again mentions, <hi>pag</hi> 51, 52 where he jeers at my contribution, calling it a Feeling argument &amp;c. wherein he ſeems to compare me to the Lawyers, who account a good Fee to be a feeling argument in their Clyents cauſe: But I ſhall not anſwer him, onely as the Proverb is, <hi>It is the property of a covetous Man to think every thing too much that another hath.</hi> But he draws up the reſult of all. <hi>pag.</hi> 68. and concludes, that the in-let and out-let, the fore-door and back-door of all our miſeries, is an ignorant, unlettered, and contemptible Miniſtery.</p>
            <p>If by the word <hi>(Our)</hi> he mean our miſery in <hi>Briſtoll,</hi> then I <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> anſwer. Surely it is ſtrange, that ſo great a flood of evill and miſery ſhould come in at ſo narrow a door, there being but one unlettered, uncalled Miniſter in <hi>Briſtoll</hi> (in his ſenſe) all the reſt (be they what they will) are learned and called, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted and eſtabliſhed Miniſters, as he mentions again, pag. 60, &amp;c. No doubt but the Princes of Iſrael, through the inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of the Prophets, thought the like of <hi>Jeremiah</hi> when they were wroth with him, ſmote him, and put him in priſon, and when they ſaid unto the King <hi>We beſeech thee let this man be</hi>

ſoul murdering Miniſtery, who have made themſelves con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible and baſe in the eyes of all good men, and in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences of many bad. And though (as I have heard) there were two thouſand of them petitioned againſt in the time of the long Parliament, and many of them then pluckt up by the roots both in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Wales;</hi> beſides what hath been ſince laid aſide for ſcandall and inſufficiency, by other Committees and Commiſſioners appointed for that purpoſe: yet I think <hi>England</hi> hath cauſe enough ſtill to mourn for, complain of, and pray againſt, a great part of the Miniſtery thereof<hi>:</hi> I do not ſpeak this of all, nor intend it to all; for I doubt not to affirm againſt the Quakers, that God hath many pretious ſervants in the Miniſtery, both among thoſe called <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> and them called <hi>Independents,</hi> and the <hi>Baptized,</hi> and ſome that are of, or under none of theſe names; yea, both learned and unlearned, &amp;c. who yet are faithfull to the Lord Jeſus, and do prefer the converſion and ſalvation of pretious ſouls, before all the treaſures in the world, and who do rejoyce to ſee that work of God carried on by any, either learned or unlearned, as men now ſpeak; and I truſt, that as the Lord, who holds the Stars in his right hand, will eſtabliſh ſuch; So the time is near, when men ſhall not wear a rough garment (or a propheticall garb) to deceive, but that the falſe Prophets and unclean ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits ſhall paſs out of the Land, and that God will raiſe up, and give Paſtors, according to his own heart, for faithful is he that hath promiſed, who alſo will do it.</p>
            <p>And whereas he ſaith, page 68. That you ſhall know them (to wit the ignorant and unlettered Miniſters) by this Badge or Character, they are ſeparating, factious, and ſchiſmaticall, &amp;c. I remember theſe were words much in uſe, and caſt as brands upon the godly people called Puritans, by the Biſhops and their Clergie about 20, or 30 years agoe, and how it comes to paſs that theſe words are taken up again, I know not, unleſs it be that the ſame ſpirit that was in the Biſhops and their Clergy is again revived<hi>:</hi> and if ſo, then they in whom it is, had beſt take heed that they apply thoſe Nicknames righter than the former did, leſt, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>But I ſhall give another Badge or Character of thoſe that
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:30607:43"/>
I mean, and that is, you ſhall alwayes know them by their pride, envy, and covetouſneſs, or their ſcorning, reviling and perſecuting all thoſe that differ from them; and therefore as he commends the caution and counſel of the Apoſtle <hi>Rom.</hi> 16. 17. 18. So ſhall I make bold humbly to recommend the caution and counſel of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Matth.</hi> 7. 15, 16. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of falſe Prophets, &amp;c. for by their fruits you ſhall know them.</hi> I do not ſpeak this of any godly man or men, for I know no godly men can do ſo as above.</p>
            <p>Now for his cloſing word to the Miniſters that are lawfully called, &amp;c. if by lawfully called he mean Paſtors or Elders, called, choſen, conſtituted, ordained and appointed to office in Churches, and by Churches, according to the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and according to the example and practice of the Churches of Chriſt both in New <hi>England</hi> and Old, then I freely cloſe with him therein; for ſuch a Calling and Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion I own and plead for according to Scripture.</p>
            <p>But if by Miniſters lawfully called, he mean all the Pariſh Miniſters in <hi>England</hi> or <hi>Briſtoll</hi> (as ſuch) then I cannot but wonder how any man pretending to godlineſs, durſt ſo to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe that pretious Scripture, <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 28. and how he will be able to prove that Pariſhes are ſuch Churches, and that all Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh Miniſters (are ſuch) and by the holy Ghoſt made Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeers in the ſenſe of that Scripture; for my own part I muſt be ſilent, and ſo I think might he well have been. It is true the 29. verſe may in a ſenſe be rightly applied to ſome men in <hi>England</hi> that call themſelves Miniſters, who ſince the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles times, and the apoſtaſie that followed, have like grievous Wolves entred in, not ſparing the flock, &amp;c. I write not this of, nor intend it to any godly man of any judgement what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever.</p>
            <p>But as for the reſt of his jerks, jeers, quibles, ſcoffs, deriſions, reproches and untruths, which he hath caſt upon me, with all the injury and wrong that he hath (thereby) done to me, I ſhall lay it at my feet looking upon it as the fruits of a froathy brain, and the products of a ſpleeniſh temper, and ſhall not beſtow a pen full of ink, or one minutes time to anſwer it, but do rather in my heart wiſh and deſire, that he may ſo repent of this piece of folly and wretchedneſs, whereby he hath harde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:30607:44"/>
the hearts, and opened the mouthes (of many againſt me) that it may do his ſoul no more hurt another day than it doth me at preſent; in the mean time I reſolve to ſit down in ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence as to him, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>And now I return again to you <hi>Denn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> Holliſter,</hi> to cloſe up my anſwer to your Book, and I cannot but take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice (as many others do) of your ſhamefull abuſing that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious upright ſervant of Jeſus Chriſt <hi>Robert Simſon,</hi> though I ſuppoſe, he will clear himſelf, or (at leaſt) his innocency will anſwer for him, and ſtop your mouth another day: In the mean time I cannot but bear a teſtimony of his integrity and your impudency, in that you do ſo fiercely and faiſly charge him to be a lyar; whereas I can teſtifie that the thing was true, which he, as meſſenger of the Church, did admoniſh you of; namely, that you ſhould ſay, that the Scripture was a blind and plague to Souls; which thing you did ſpeak at a publick meeting in your own houſe, as I doubt not but there are more than twenty perſons, ſome of the Church, and others not of the Church, who can alſo teſtifie the ſame. Whether your mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning was then as now you write, <hi>pag.</hi> 18, 19. I ſhall not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute; but that you did ſpeak thoſe words is true, and no lye invented, nor lye proſecuted, &amp;c. Therefore if there be any lyar in this thing, you are the lyar; yet I durſt nor judge you to the Lake, but rather pray &amp; hope that God may ſhew a miracle of mercy in ſaying you from it, and do adviſe you to take heed how you throw them into the Lake, or under condemnation, whom Jeſus Chriſt hath by his pretious blood, and perfect righteouſneſs graciouſly freed from it. And as for the ſin of lying, you will do well to eaſt the beam out of your own eye, &amp;c. For <hi>Robert Simpſon</hi> is a man as well known in <hi>Briſtoll</hi> to be a truth ſpeaker, and a juſt, upright, conſcientious dealer, as any of thoſe that do accuſe him. I ſhall ſay no more, but let every man prove his own work, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 4.</p>
            <p>But paſſing by many of thoſe impertinencies in your book, I find that after your letter to me, there is an anſwer to 16. <hi>Queries,</hi> formerly ſent to you, or to the people called <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers,</hi> and afterwards printed by that pretious ſervant of Chriſt, <hi>John Pendarves</hi> before his death.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="69" facs="tcp:30607:44"/>
I might commend your wit, in putting forth your an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer after the man is dead<hi>:</hi> Secondly, I obſerve that theſe ſixteen Queries have been once anſwered (in a faſhion) by <hi>Iames Naylor,</hi> a man then highly admired and cried up by you, or thoſe of your way, as a man of great infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, which perhaps might help to puff him up with pride, by which he came to fall into this fad condemnation, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Now whereas ſome of your way, boaſt much of your being all led by one and the ſame Spirit, ſo that though they were at a great diſtance, yet they all ſpeak but one thing, &amp;c. Now let any man read and compare your an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers with <hi>Iames Naylors,</hi> and ſee how near they come together, unleſs it be in railing, judging, and cenſuring, though therein I muſt needs ſay his anſwers are more mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate than yours.</p>
            <p>And whereas a late Writer for your way, puts it by way of deriſion to the Preachers in <hi>England,</hi> that if ſix of the moſt able Doctors, ſhould have a portion of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture given them to interpret, and they ſhut up in ſix ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral rooms, &amp;c. that perhaps not two of the ſix agree in their interpretation.</p>
            <p>Now ſuppoſe you had taken four more of your Teachers, (ſuch as ſome of you had challenged the whole world to accuſe of ſin) and made them ſix in number, and have given them theſe ſixteen Quaeries apart to anſwer, perhaps they would have come as rear, as you and <hi>Naylor</hi> do in your anſwers, or as ſix of the weakeſt Preachers in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> might have done in their interpreting a place of Scripture.</p>
            <p>As for your word to <hi>England,</hi> I ſhall ſay little to that, but deſire rather to mourn for the evils and abominations therein, as I know it is my duty and yours alſo, if you knew how to do it; and ſo I conclude, expecting that I ſhall have many ſharp Arrows of bitter words ſhot at me, both by you and others; but for that I matter not much, being conſcious to my ſelf, that I have written in plainneſs words of truth and ſoberneſs, and that I have been preſſed by others to do what I have done, and that rather, for the
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:30607:45"/>
vindication of truth, than of my ſelf, and rather for the ſakes of ſome godly people who may read it, than for your ſakes to whom I direct it; and if you or others, ſhall dip your pens in Vineger or Gall to write again, I hope I ſhall bear it, or modeſtly reply to it, though my thoughts, are rather to ſuffer my ſelf to be trampled upon, then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain to anſwer a word, ſeeing that of making many Books there is no end, and much ſtudy is a wearineſs of the fleſh, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 12. 12. And knowing alſo that neither you nor others, can ſpeak or write me ſo vile, as I can and do, ſee, and acknowledge my ſelf to be, as in my ſelf, yet is my perfection and compleatneſs in another, even in Chriſt Jeſus my Lord; in whom is all righteouſneſs, all ſtrength, and all fulneſs, laid up for all thoſe, that ſenſibly ſee and feel that in them, (that is in their fleſh) dwelleth no good thing, &amp;c. and thereupon do look unto him, to receive of his fulneſs, grace for grace; in which glorious perſon, all that do believe are juſtified, and by whoſe grace and bleſſed Spirit, they are in a meaſure ſanctified, and through whoſe pretious blood, and perfect righteouſneſs, media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and interceſſion, they ſhall be eternally ſaved, and in whoſe way, I could as gladly now as ever, ſubſcribe my ſelf,</p>
